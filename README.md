I thought it'd be cool to have my own RAG pipelines for some of the most influential social figures in history. 

## CRITERIA FOR SELECTING AUTHORS: 
- Text used must be in the public domain. Due to the ongoing uncertainty about the exact legal standing of AI applications trained on (or otherwise based) on copyrighted material, only individuals whose works are in the public domain will be considered. This is highly regrettable, as there are a great many people that I would have liked to include. 

- The author must have had a significant social, political, or intellectual impact on large numbers of people. The exact scale of impact isn't something that I can quantify precisely. However, their candidacy will be strengthened if:
    - They made significant contributions to the socio-economic or political outlook of large numbers of people 
    - Their work continues to have enduring relevance to their field of study many decades after their passing. 
    - They led or otherwise made notable contributions to major intellectual, political, spiritual, or socio-economic movements of their time.
    - They produced a significant body of written works or speeches.
    
## TO DO: 
My immediate intention is to find the best way to implement long-term memory, so that I can produce a conversational experience. I'm exploring a few ways of doing this. Some methods involve using frameworks like Langgraph (which I'm not a huge fan of), Zep, LlamaIndex, and so on. There's also the vanilla approach, which involves attempting to do this without using a framework at all. I like the sound of that but I want to give frameworks one more try.
