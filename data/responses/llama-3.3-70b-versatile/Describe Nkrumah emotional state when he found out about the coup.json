        "question": "Describe Nkrumah emotional state when he found out about the coup",
        "context": ". Our national assets had never stood so high. We had laid the infra- structure for the development of Ghana into a modem, industrial state. Our real wealth - our roads, communications, Tema harbour the Volta River Project, our educational and public health systems, our factories, state corporations, hotels and public buildings - was reflected in actual achievement and in productive potential. Economic experts the world over, unless the tools of vested com- mercial interests, acknowledged that the progress we had made in Ghana was amazing and beyond what even the most optimistic had believed possible. But for the treachery of the NLC, the whole of Ghana would by now have been electrified. Industrialization would have taken place not only in the South, but in every region including the far North. Every town and village would have had ample electricity and piped water. There would have been further expansion of both the health and education services. There would have been a tremendous increase in food production. We had developed plans for the vast grasslands of the North. Only days before the 'coup', I had signed a contract for the irrigation and agricultural development of the Accra plains. Our scheme to create an inland fishing industry and inland water transport on the Volta Lake was near to operation. We were waiting only for the water to rise. All these schemes, and they were nation-wide, would have required the active participation of tens of thousands more of our people. Every young man and woman was needed as soon as he or she had completed the necessary education. How criminal that our resources of people and materials should now be wasted in mass unemploy- ment, and that our immense productive potential should be put at the disposal of neo-colonialists serving their own selfish interests. The Ghanaian, who was before a proud African, courageous and with head held high, today appears head-bowed as a collaborator with neo-colonialists. He is suffering as a result of the shame that has been brought on Ghana by the imperialist-inspired coup of February 24th, 1966. Ghana, under my government, was a haven for the oppressed from all parts of Africaexposed themselves in their true colours for all to see. By their  very actions, on 24th February and in the months of \"N.L.C.\"  rule, they have clearly shown themselves to be traitors to their  country and the stooges of neo-colonialism. They have dis\u00ad played their reactionary nature, their complete disregard for  the common man and for the progress of the African Revolu\u00ad tion.  It is like when you boil a pot hard; all the bits and pieces of  useless stuff come to the top and you are able to skim them off  easily. It is necessary to realise, that, in many ways, the  so-called \"coup d'etat\" has not been a set-back but has been  merely a symptom of how neo-colo nialism is breaking down.  Almost all African countries came to independence without  armed struggle. This meant that it was impossible, in practice,  to reconstruct these new states upon a socialist basis  immediately. I was well aware of the compromises which  it was necessary to make and the dangers which this entailed  but Ghana's independence on any condition was the first  essential in securing the freedom of Africa. Not to have  seized independence when we had a chance of obtaining  it, whatever the liability we inherited, would have been  criminal. The circumstances under which the C.P.P. was  formed resulted in it being a compromise organisation com\u00ad posed of some genuine revolutionaries but containing many  of those who are interested in independence only so as to  better themselves and to take the place of the previous  colonial traders and businessmen. This meant that I had to  include in any government which I formed representatives  of all tendencies in the Party including businessmen on the  make such as Emmanuel Ayeh-Kumi and William Halm.  In the circumstances of the day there was at least a reason\u00b7  able chance that such people would act honestly and would  assist to build the state on a new basis.  The experiment which we tried in Ghana was essentially  one of developing the country in co-op eration with the world  as a whole. Non-alignment meant exactly what it saidof the fact that your whole life was dedicated to the  total liberation, the total survival of all mankind, and  particularly, for the progress and well-being of the  African continent and its peoples-the solution, so far  as the colonialists are concerned, was only to find ways  and means of subversion, to put a yes-man traitor in  your place as Head of State.  The question which every nationalist asks him /her\u00ad self is : \"Is it the end of the African Revolution, or is  it just a beginning?\" During the last fifteen years,  Africa has lost more outstanding leaders and statesmen  than Europe and Asia put together. Patrice Lumumba  was murdered; Ahmed Ben Bella ousted, and no one  knows of his whereabouts, except those concerned;  Joshua Nkomo is in the hands of those diabolical white  settlers in Rhodesia; and last but most important of all,  the great African leader, President K wame Nkrumah  is missing (though only for a temporary period of time).  So far, the colon ialists have succeeded in playing  with Africa, and the cold war has been shifted to all  corners of this continent, which used to be the most  peaceful place for man to live in-without disturbance  and want. Heavy wounds are inflicted on us, and it  seems our recovery is doubted .... I vowed to follow  to the end any genuine African leader who dedicates  his life for the common good, common welfare, com\u00ad mon progress, and the total liberation of Africa as a  whole. I am very sure of your greatness, President  Nkrumah, and I am ready to die for you because I feel  that my life is nothing to be compared with yours. You  have saved millions of lives, and the peoples of all  countries recognise your achievements.  Since that shameful time of February 1966, I and  friends of mine in the Somali Republic have been  actively collecting information from the Somali masses,  and we have been fully assured by thousands that they  are ready to serve the great African leader, President  K wame Nkrumah, even at the cost of their lives. I  sincerely hope that the President will give us the oppor\u00ad tunity to fight for our good future and for the future  of all the peoples of our continent.  153.  Nobody outside Accra knew what had happened, or was hap\u00ad pening. In some cases, particularly in the remoter districts, it  was days before they realised what had taken place. Even then,  the full implications of the am1y and police action dawned  only slowly as they began gradually to see through the lies  poured out over the radio and in the press, and saw with their  own eyes the way in v.:hich the independence and progress of  their beloved country was being destroyed, and its assets sold  to foreign interests.  In Accra, military police and soldiers in full battle dress  and armed with sub-machine guns patrolled the streets. In  such circumstances, and with all the Party leadership arrested,  it was not surprising that there was no immediate and open  resistance. But secret, underground resistance began at once.  28. The Ghanaian, who was before a proud African, courageous and with head held high, today appears head-bowed as a collaborator with neo-colonialists. He is suffering as a result of the shame that has been brought on Ghana by the imperialist-inspired coup of February 24th, 1966. Ghana, under my government, was a haven for the oppressed from all parts of Africa. Freedom fighters trained there. Ghana was revered all over the African continent, as a country which all who fought oppression and exploitation could depend upon. Our political and economic achievements were closely studied and admired. Today, Ghana might not exist for all the impact the country makes in Africa and in world affairs. It is as if the heart has been tom out of the body, and only a lifeless robot remains, the mechanism controlled by a clique of traitors who in their turn are slavishly following the instructions of their neo-colonialist masters. Yet there is no need to despair or to abandon hope. We have the mind, the will and the means to rebuild our country for the prosperity and happiness of all our people. All that stands in the way is the NLC and their abject subservience to foreign exploiters. People of Ghana, stir yourselves. Rise up as free men and women. Be proud of your heritage and of your national independence. What the criminal NLC has destroyed can be rebuilt. Our development plans can once again be put into operation.. For noreason other than morbid ambition, inordinate and selfish desire for power, certain officers of my Armed Forces took advantage of my absence from Accra to subvert and rebel against constitutional authority. This reactionary rebellion sought to perpetrate subversive activities against the lawfully constituted Government of Ghana. What has taken place in Ghana is not a coup d'etat but a rebellion and it shall be crushed by its own actions. At the moment you are being suppressed at the point of guns and bayonets and you are made speechless by these same instruments. You are forbidden to hold your rallies and meetings. But, I know that even in silence you are determined and resisting. Be assured that I am standing firm behind you. There is a Russian proverb which says that one cannot screen the sun by the palm of a hand; nor can I be destroyed by telling lies about me. Very soon I shall be with you again. The perpetrators of this rebellion have committed an act of high treason. Those soldiers of my army who have taken power in my absence have issued orders that our 9th Anniversary of Independence, a great national day, should not be celebrated. This shows that they are suppressing you at the points of guns and bayonets. They cannot destroy what we have taken years to build. For, what we have achieved is built on rock foundations and is indestructible. Forward Ever, Backward Never. There is Victory for Us. I am safe and well. I will be with you in due course. Have courage and bear your humiliation and sufferings with fortitude. What has happened is only a phase of our struggle and it shall pass. Long live the people of Ghana Long live the Convention People's Party Long live the liberation movement of Africa Long live the African continental government that must be.was said, Russian planes were landing on a secret airstrip in  northern Ghana. Furthermore a secret tunnel had been made  from Flagstaff House, the presidential residence, to Accra air\u00ad port, and for days Russians had been arriving. The only way  to save Ghana, and to avoid being sent to fight in Vietnam, the  troops were told, was to take Flagstaff House.  Several days after the military seizure of power, Kotoka and  Afrifa appeared on Ghana TV congratulating themselves on  their easy success. One remark stood out unmistakable and  clear: \"And you know, we didn't find any Russians at all\u00ad not one! Nor could we find any trace of that tunnel.\" This  was followed by peals of laughter at the poor soldiers who  had believed their story.  The first object of the military operation was to force the  surrender of Major-General Barwah, Army Chief of Staff and  Deputy Chief of Defence Staff, who was in command of the  Ghana Army in the absence from the country of the Chief of  Defence Staff, General Aferi. At the same time, Brigadier  Hasan, Head of Military Intelligence, and Colonel Zanerigu,  Commander of the Presidential Guard Regiment, and Owusu\u00ad Sekyere, former head of the C.I.D. and in charge of the Special  Branch. were to be arrested.  This stage of the operation was badly bungled. Hasan was  arrested, but Zanerigu, when confronted, escaped through a  window of his house and drove to Flagstaff House to warn the  Presidential Guard Regiment. Barwah could not be intimi\u00ad dated. Woken from his sleep in the early hours of the morning  of the 24th by the arrival of Kotoka and some 25 men, he  courageously refused either to join the traitors or to surrender.  Thereupon, Kotoka shot him dead at point-black range in  cold blood in the presence of his wife and children. The  seven security officers who were stationed at Barwah's house  were also murdered on the spot on Kotoka's ordersthe \"heroes of the counter-revolution\", the criminal detainees.  These people assaulted women, thieved, and looted. It will  be only after the return to legal government in Ghana that  it will be possible to assess exactly the number of those who  died in fighting against the rebel soldiers or were subsequently  killed in the looting and robbery which followed. The casual\u00ad ties in the fighting were certainly heavy. The number of  civilians killed, it is more difficult to estimate. Two members  of Parliament certainly lost their lives and a number of people  in no way connected with politics died. Among those shot  dead near Flagstaff House was an air hostess on her way to  the airport. In all, the total was probably around 1, 600 dead  and many more injured . So much for the \"bloodless coup\"!  One thing is clear. Never before in the cherished history  of our new Ghana had citizens, defenceless men and women,  been assassinated in cold blood by their own soldiers. Not a  single Ghanaian life was taken during the whole fifteen years  of my administration. There are few, if any, governments  in the world which can say as much. Yet here was this  handful of traitors at one blow spoiling our proud record, and  dragging Ghana's name through the mud.  In the days which followed the insurrection, hundreds of  patriotic Ghanaians were thrown into prison. All ministers.  M.P.s , officials of the Party and of all its subsidiary and  associate organisations including the trade unions were  arrested and detained. The same applied to branch officers  throughout the country. In fact, the entire leadership, except  for the few who managed to escape or go into hiding, was  at one swoop rounded up and thrown into prison.  The prison authorities, with some exceptions, continued  to act in the humane and considerate way which we had  insisted upon in the prison service, since the establishment  of independence. The Director of Prisons, in particular, saw  to it that no one, insofar as he could prevent it, once inside  the prison, was ill-treatedpossible to extend, its grip on the economic life of our con\u00ad tinent.  An all-out offensive is being waged against the progressive,  independent states. Where the more subtle methods of econ\u00ad omic pressure and political subversion have failed to achieve  the desired result, there has been resort to violence in order  to promote a change of regime and prepare the way for the  establishment of a puppet government.  Fragmented into so many separate states, many of them  weak and economically non-viable, coup d'etats have been  relatively easy to arrange in Africa. All that has been needed  was a small force of disciplined men to seize the key points of  the capital city and to arrest the existing political leadership.  In the planning and carrying out of these coups there have  always been just sufficient numbers of dissatisfied and ambiti\u00ad ous army officers and politicians willing to co-operate to make  the whole operation possible.  It has been one of the tasks of the C.I.A and other similar  organisations to discover these potential quislings and traitors  in our midst, and to encourage them, t; bribery and the pro\u00ad mise of political power, to destroy the constitutional govern\u00ad ment of their countries. In Ghana the embassies of the United  States, Britain, and West Germany were all implicated in the  plot to overthrow my government. It is alleged that the U.S.  Ambassador, Franklin Williams, offered the traitors 13 million  dollars to carry out a coup d'etat. Afrifa, Hadley and Kotoka  were to get a large share of this if they would assassinate me at  Accra airport as I prepared to leave for Hanoi. I understand  Afrifa said: \"I think I will fail'', and declined the offer.  So apparently did the others.  It is particularly disgraceful that it should have been an  Afro-American ambassador who sold himself out to the  imperialists and allowed himself to be used in this way. It was  this same man who deliberately lied when he publicly des\u00ad cribed the coup as \"bloodless7  AWAKENING  The unremitting, though ineffectual, attacks made by the  military and police traitors on my government and on myself  may be partly explained by the strength of the resistance  they encountered. Right from the start, men and women began  to meet secretly to talk about what had taken place and to  discuss what should be done. Loyal members of the Party  began to organise underground resistance. Soon posters and  slogans began to appear on walls of buildings in Accra and  elsewhere, calling on the people to rise up and overthrow the  traitors. Leaflets were printed and distributed, though restric\u00ad tions were placed on the sale of paper, and the police instructed  sellers to take the names and addresses of anyone purchasing  an unusual amount of stationery. Ghanaians had a rude awak\u00ad ening as they began to experience the bitter consequences of  the overthrow of the constitutional government and \"N.L.C.\"  treachery.  In London, two organisations went into immediate action:  the Overseas Branch of the Party, and the Socialist Ghana  Defence Committee. They began a campaign to inform the  public of the true state of affairs in Ghana. I quote the state\u00ad ment issued by the Party Overseas :  An illegal military rebellion has taken place in  Ghana and is trying to seize power.  The Convention People's Party Overseas regard this  not only as a rebellion of leading mil itary figures and  reactionaries inside the country who have long opposed  the progressive steps taken by President Nkrumah and  his Government, but that it is also supported and even  organised by the most reactionary forces outside  Ghana.  The rebellion in Ghana is occurring after similar  11 3",
        "response": "Unfortunately, the context does not explicitly describe Nkrumah's emotional state when he found out about the coup. However, based on the text, it can be inferred that Nkrumah was likely feeling a mix of emotions such as shock, anger, and sadness.\n\nThe context quotes Nkrumah as saying \"What has happened is only a phase of our struggle and it shall pass\" and \"Have courage and bear your humiliation and sufferings with fortitude\", which suggests that he was trying to remain calm and resilient in the face of adversity. Additionally, he states \"I am safe and well\" which may indicate that he was trying to reassure his supporters and maintain a sense of stability.\n\nHowever, the context also conveys a sense of outrage and condemnation towards the perpetrators of the coup, with Nkrumah describing them as \"traitors\" and \"stooges of neo-colonialism\". This suggests that he was deeply upset and angry about the coup and its aftermath.\n\nOverall, while the context does not provide a direct description of Nkrumah's emotional state, it can be inferred that he was likely feeling a complex mix of emotions, including shock, anger, sadness, and resilience.",
