        "question": "How did the coup affect Ghana's development?",
        "context": ". Our national assets had never stood so high. We had laid the infra- structure for the development of Ghana into a modem, industrial state. Our real wealth - our roads, communications, Tema harbour the Volta River Project, our educational and public health systems, our factories, state corporations, hotels and public buildings - was reflected in actual achievement and in productive potential. Economic experts the world over, unless the tools of vested com- mercial interests, acknowledged that the progress we had made in Ghana was amazing and beyond what even the most optimistic had believed possible. But for the treachery of the NLC, the whole of Ghana would by now have been electrified. Industrialization would have taken place not only in the South, but in every region including the far North. Every town and village would have had ample electricity and piped water. There would have been further expansion of both the health and education services. There would have been a tremendous increase in food production. We had developed plans for the vast grasslands of the North. Only days before the 'coup', I had signed a contract for the irrigation and agricultural development of the Accra plains. Our scheme to create an inland fishing industry and inland water transport on the Volta Lake was near to operation. We were waiting only for the water to rise. All these schemes, and they were nation-wide, would have required the active participation of tens of thousands more of our people. Every young man and woman was needed as soon as he or she had completed the necessary education. How criminal that our resources of people and materials should now be wasted in mass unemploy- ment, and that our immense productive potential should be put at the disposal of neo-colonialists serving their own selfish interests. The Ghanaian, who was before a proud African, courageous and with head held high, today appears head-bowed as a collaborator with neo-colonialists. He is suffering as a result of the shame that has been brought on Ghana by the imperialist-inspired coup of February 24th, 1966. Ghana, under my government, was a haven for the oppressed from all parts of Africaof our development plans and of their implementation reveals  the truth-that it was their success and not their failure which  spurred our enemies into action. Ghana, on the threshold of  economic independence, and in the vanguard of the African  revolutionary struggle to achieve continental liberation and  unity, was too dangerous an example to the rest of Africa to  be allowed to continue under a socialist-directed government.  In the first ten years of its administration, the Ghana gov\u00ad ernment drew up the First and Second Five Year Development  Plans (19 51-19 56 and 19 59-1 964), and the Consolidation Plan,  which covered the two-year gap between these Plans (1 957- 19 59). Under these Plans the foundations were to be laid for  the modernisation and industrialisation of Ghana. A skilled  labour force was to be trained and an adequate complement  of public services built up such as transport, electricity, water  and telecommunications.  We had to work fast. Under colonial rule, foreign monopoly  interests had tied up our whole economy to suit themselves.  We had not a single industry. Our economy was dependent on  one cash crop--cocoa. Although our output of cocoa is the  largest in the world, there was not a single cocoa processing  factory.  Before we took office in 1951 there was no direct railway  between Accra and Takoradi, in those days our main port.  Passengers and freight had to travel by way of Kumasi. This  was because Kumasi was the centre of the timber and mining  ind ustries, both of which served foreign interests and were  therefore well supplied with the necessary communications.  There were few roads, and only a very rudimentary public  transport system. For the most part, people walked from place  to place. There were very few hospitals, schools or clinics.  Most of our villages lacked a piped water supply. In fact, the  nakedness of the land when my government began in 1951 has  to have been experienced to be believed.  Failure to promote the interests of our people was due to the  insatiable demands of colonial exploitationindependence - real economic independence. The 'NLC' replaced it with a two-year 'review period' during which the socialized industries would be dismantled and the door opened once more to unrestricted 'private enterprise' - in fact, they were establishing a neo-colonialist economic subjugation of Ghana. The only Ghanaians to benefit from such a sell-out were the African middle-class hangers-on to noo-colonialist privilege and the neo-colonialist trading firms. For the mass of workers, peasants and farmers, the victims of the capitalist free-for-all, it meant a return to the position of 'drawers of water and hewers of wood' to Western capitalism. Of course, the Ghanaian economy was not without its problems, but is this not true of all national economies, and particularly those of developing countries in the context of the growing gap between rich and poor nations? In any event, these difficulties were not determinant. It was no mean achievement that in January 1965, after five years as a Republic, Ghana had 63 state enterprises and a budget of \u00a3200 million, including a supplementary budget, for its population of nearly eight million; while Nigeria, richer in national resources and with a population of 55 million, had a budget of \u00a378 million. Imperialist circles have talked much about Ghana's external debt, given as \u00a3250 million. Apart from the dubious accounting which arrived at this conveniently round sum, a figure such as this means nothing unless it is set in the context of the overall Ghanaian econo- mic situation. To implement our various Development Plans it was necessary to borrow considerable sums of money, but it was borrowed on the basis of building capital assets such as the Volta dam, and over 100 industries established in Ghana since indepen- dence. The government made sure that the international agreements signed were based on economic feasibility, and that the money borrowed could create something lasting and beneficial not only for us in our lifetime but for the generations to follow. Seen in the light of Ghana's growing industries and increasing exports, her 'indebted- ness' is put in proper perspective - as an index of the investors' confi- dence in the enterprise and the management they helped to financesocialism, which were published and circulated freely in  Britain, were banned in the British colonial empire, and after  Ghana became independent it was assumed abroad that it  would continue to follow the same restrictive ideological  approach. When we behaved as did the British in their rela\u00ad tions with the socialist countries we were accused of being  pro-R ussian and introd ucing the most dangerous ideas into  Africa.  In fact, the fault was that, from the very circumstances  in which we found ourselves , we were unable to introduce  more \"dangerous ideas\" or to get them more widely under\u00ad stood. What went wrong in Ghana was not that we attempted  to have friendly relations with the countries of the socialist  world but that we maintained too friendly relations with  the countries of the western bloc.  Before the military revolt the policy of Ghana was based  upon an attempt to develop the country along what were  essentially socialist lines. This policy could have succeeded  had the western world been prepared to see coming into  existence a genuinely independent African state. In fact,  they were not prepared to do so and we thus gave innumer\u00ad able hostages to fortune.  The \"coup d'etat\" on its surface was a military revolt  against myself and what I stood for. If it is analysed more  deeply, however, it is a mark of the breakdown of the western  attempt to influence and control Africa. The western coun\u00ad tries, having failed to control democratically supported Afri\u00ad can governments, were forced into the final extremity of  substituting regimes which depended upon no other mandate  than the weapons which they held in their hands. Such puppet  governments cannot survive for long either in Ghana or else\u00ad where in Africa. They are, in the first place, based on internal  contradictions. Why they are tolerated is that their initial  popularity is due to a sort of sympathetic magic. The pros\u00ad perity of the western world at the moment depends upon  exploiting less developed countries. Each year the western  world pays less for its imports and each year charges more  for its exportsREPERCUSSIONS  The position of the \"N.L.C.\", always precarious, has been  made even more shaky by the attitude of the progressive inde\u00ad pendent states of Africa. and the exposure of the so-called  \"coup\" as counter-r evolutionary and reactionary.  As soon as the army and police traitors seized power in my  absence from Ghana, repercussions in the rest of Africa, and  overseas, showed that there was a full awareness of the under\u00ad lying political implications. Through all the smoke- screen of  lies and propaganda, the action was clearly recognised as a  blow struck by imperialists ond neo-colonialists and their  agents against socialism and the African Revolution. The  taking sides \"for\" and \"against\" showed once again the famil\u00ad iar groupings of-on the one side, those who are struggling to  achieve socialism and the total liberation and unity of the  African continent, and on the other, those who want to  maintain the status quo, and are fighting a desperate rearguard  action to halt the liberation movement.  Both sides have regarded Ghana as a key factor in the  struggle. Since independence, Ghana has thrown herself freely  and boldly into the struggle for African emancipation. We  have proclaimed our firm stand against imperialism, coloni\u00ad alism and neo-colonialism. We have unflinchingly stated that  the independence of Ghana is meaningless unless it is  linked up with the total liberation of the African continent.  Before 24th February 1966, Ghana was a haven to which  the oppressed from all parts of Africa could come to carry on  their struggle. Freedom fighters and political refugees from  South Africa, Rhodesia, Mozambique, Angola, so-called Por\u00ad tuguese Guinea, the Cape Verde Islands, and other oppressed  colonial areas, were given hospitality and encouragement  amongst us. Ghana was to them a symbol of hope and an  inspiration. It was a centre where they could meet to discuss  common problems. and where they could organise and train.  132",
        "response": "According to the context, the coup had a significantly negative impact on Ghana's development. As stated, \"But for the treachery of the NLC, the whole of Ghana would by now have been electrified. Industrialization would have taken place not only in the South, but in every region including the far North.\" This suggests that the coup derailed the country's plans for industrialization and electrification. \n\nFurthermore, the context notes that \"Every town and village would have had ample electricity and piped water. There would have been further expansion of both the health and education services. There would have been a tremendous increase in food production.\" These plans were also affected by the coup, as the context states that \"our immense productive potential should be put at the disposal of neo-colonialists serving their own selfish interests.\"\n\nAdditionally, the context mentions that \"We had developed plans for the vast grasslands of the North. Only days before the 'coup', I had signed a contract for the irrigation and agricultural development of the Accra plains.\" These plans were also disrupted by the coup, leading to a significant setback in Ghana's development. \n\nOverall, the coup led to a significant reversal of Ghana's development progress, with the country's resources being exploited by neo-colonialists, and the mass of workers, peasants, and farmers suffering as a result. As stated, \"The Ghanaian, who was before a proud African, courageous and with head held high, today appears head-bowed as a collaborator with neo-colonialists.\"",
