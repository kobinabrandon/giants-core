        "question": "How did the coup affect Ghana's development?",
        "context": ". Our national assets had never stood so high. We had laid the infra- structure for the development of Ghana into a modem, industrial state. Our real wealth - our roads, communications, Tema harbour the Volta River Project, our educational and public health systems, our factories, state corporations, hotels and public buildings - was reflected in actual achievement and in productive potential. Economic experts the world over, unless the tools of vested com- mercial interests, acknowledged that the progress we had made in Ghana was amazing and beyond what even the most optimistic had believed possible. But for the treachery of the NLC, the whole of Ghana would by now have been electrified. Industrialization would have taken place not only in the South, but in every region including the far North. Every town and village would have had ample electricity and piped water. There would have been further expansion of both the health and education services. There would have been a tremendous increase in food production. We had developed plans for the vast grasslands of the North. Only days before the 'coup', I had signed a contract for the irrigation and agricultural development of the Accra plains. Our scheme to create an inland fishing industry and inland water transport on the Volta Lake was near to operation. We were waiting only for the water to rise. All these schemes, and they were nation-wide, would have required the active participation of tens of thousands more of our people. Every young man and woman was needed as soon as he or she had completed the necessary education. How criminal that our resources of people and materials should now be wasted in mass unemploy- ment, and that our immense productive potential should be put at the disposal of neo-colonialists serving their own selfish interests. The Ghanaian, who was before a proud African, courageous and with head held high, today appears head-bowed as a collaborator with neo-colonialists. He is suffering as a result of the shame that has been brought on Ghana by the imperialist-inspired coup of February 24th, 1966. Ghana, under my government, was a haven for the oppressed from all parts of Africaof our development plans and of their implementation reveals  the truth-that it was their success and not their failure which  spurred our enemies into action. Ghana, on the threshold of  economic independence, and in the vanguard of the African  revolutionary struggle to achieve continental liberation and  unity, was too dangerous an example to the rest of Africa to  be allowed to continue under a socialist-directed government.  In the first ten years of its administration, the Ghana gov\u00ad ernment drew up the First and Second Five Year Development  Plans (19 51-19 56 and 19 59-1 964), and the Consolidation Plan,  which covered the two-year gap between these Plans (1 957- 19 59). Under these Plans the foundations were to be laid for  the modernisation and industrialisation of Ghana. A skilled  labour force was to be trained and an adequate complement  of public services built up such as transport, electricity, water  and telecommunications.  We had to work fast. Under colonial rule, foreign monopoly  interests had tied up our whole economy to suit themselves.  We had not a single industry. Our economy was dependent on  one cash crop--cocoa. Although our output of cocoa is the  largest in the world, there was not a single cocoa processing  factory.  Before we took office in 1951 there was no direct railway  between Accra and Takoradi, in those days our main port.  Passengers and freight had to travel by way of Kumasi. This  was because Kumasi was the centre of the timber and mining  ind ustries, both of which served foreign interests and were  therefore well supplied with the necessary communications.  There were few roads, and only a very rudimentary public  transport system. For the most part, people walked from place  to place. There were very few hospitals, schools or clinics.  Most of our villages lacked a piped water supply. In fact, the  nakedness of the land when my government began in 1951 has  to have been experienced to be believed.  Failure to promote the interests of our people was due to the  insatiable demands of colonial exploitationindependence - real economic independence. The 'NLC' replaced it with a two-year 'review period' during which the socialized industries would be dismantled and the door opened once more to unrestricted 'private enterprise' - in fact, they were establishing a neo-colonialist economic subjugation of Ghana. The only Ghanaians to benefit from such a sell-out were the African middle-class hangers-on to noo-colonialist privilege and the neo-colonialist trading firms. For the mass of workers, peasants and farmers, the victims of the capitalist free-for-all, it meant a return to the position of 'drawers of water and hewers of wood' to Western capitalism. Of course, the Ghanaian economy was not without its problems, but is this not true of all national economies, and particularly those of developing countries in the context of the growing gap between rich and poor nations? In any event, these difficulties were not determinant. It was no mean achievement that in January 1965, after five years as a Republic, Ghana had 63 state enterprises and a budget of \u00a3200 million, including a supplementary budget, for its population of nearly eight million; while Nigeria, richer in national resources and with a population of 55 million, had a budget of \u00a378 million. Imperialist circles have talked much about Ghana's external debt, given as \u00a3250 million. Apart from the dubious accounting which arrived at this conveniently round sum, a figure such as this means nothing unless it is set in the context of the overall Ghanaian econo- mic situation. To implement our various Development Plans it was necessary to borrow considerable sums of money, but it was borrowed on the basis of building capital assets such as the Volta dam, and over 100 industries established in Ghana since indepen- dence. The government made sure that the international agreements signed were based on economic feasibility, and that the money borrowed could create something lasting and beneficial not only for us in our lifetime but for the generations to follow. Seen in the light of Ghana's growing industries and increasing exports, her 'indebted- ness' is put in proper perspective - as an index of the investors' confi- dence in the enterprise and the management they helped to financesocialism, which were published and circulated freely in  Britain, were banned in the British colonial empire, and after  Ghana became independent it was assumed abroad that it  would continue to follow the same restrictive ideological  approach. When we behaved as did the British in their rela\u00ad tions with the socialist countries we were accused of being  pro-R ussian and introd ucing the most dangerous ideas into  Africa.  In fact, the fault was that, from the very circumstances  in which we found ourselves , we were unable to introduce  more \"dangerous ideas\" or to get them more widely under\u00ad stood. What went wrong in Ghana was not that we attempted  to have friendly relations with the countries of the socialist  world but that we maintained too friendly relations with  the countries of the western bloc.  Before the military revolt the policy of Ghana was based  upon an attempt to develop the country along what were  essentially socialist lines. This policy could have succeeded  had the western world been prepared to see coming into  existence a genuinely independent African state. In fact,  they were not prepared to do so and we thus gave innumer\u00ad able hostages to fortune.  The \"coup d'etat\" on its surface was a military revolt  against myself and what I stood for. If it is analysed more  deeply, however, it is a mark of the breakdown of the western  attempt to influence and control Africa. The western coun\u00ad tries, having failed to control democratically supported Afri\u00ad can governments, were forced into the final extremity of  substituting regimes which depended upon no other mandate  than the weapons which they held in their hands. Such puppet  governments cannot survive for long either in Ghana or else\u00ad where in Africa. They are, in the first place, based on internal  contradictions. Why they are tolerated is that their initial  popularity is due to a sort of sympathetic magic. The pros\u00ad perity of the western world at the moment depends upon  exploiting less developed countries. Each year the western  world pays less for its imports and each year charges more  for its exportsREPERCUSSIONS  The position of the \"N.L.C.\", always precarious, has been  made even more shaky by the attitude of the progressive inde\u00ad pendent states of Africa. and the exposure of the so-called  \"coup\" as counter-r evolutionary and reactionary.  As soon as the army and police traitors seized power in my  absence from Ghana, repercussions in the rest of Africa, and  overseas, showed that there was a full awareness of the under\u00ad lying political implications. Through all the smoke- screen of  lies and propaganda, the action was clearly recognised as a  blow struck by imperialists ond neo-colonialists and their  agents against socialism and the African Revolution. The  taking sides \"for\" and \"against\" showed once again the famil\u00ad iar groupings of-on the one side, those who are struggling to  achieve socialism and the total liberation and unity of the  African continent, and on the other, those who want to  maintain the status quo, and are fighting a desperate rearguard  action to halt the liberation movement.  Both sides have regarded Ghana as a key factor in the  struggle. Since independence, Ghana has thrown herself freely  and boldly into the struggle for African emancipation. We  have proclaimed our firm stand against imperialism, coloni\u00ad alism and neo-colonialism. We have unflinchingly stated that  the independence of Ghana is meaningless unless it is  linked up with the total liberation of the African continent.  Before 24th February 1966, Ghana was a haven to which  the oppressed from all parts of Africa could come to carry on  their struggle. Freedom fighters and political refugees from  South Africa, Rhodesia, Mozambique, Angola, so-called Por\u00ad tuguese Guinea, the Cape Verde Islands, and other oppressed  colonial areas, were given hospitality and encouragement  amongst us. Ghana was to them a symbol of hope and an  inspiration. It was a centre where they could meet to discuss  common problems. and where they could organise and train.  132",

Ghana, on the threshold of economicindependence, and in the vanguard of the African revolutionary struggle to achieve continental liberation and unity, wastoo dangerous an exampleto the rest of Africa to be allowedto continue under a socialist-directed government. In the first ten years of its administration, the Ghana government drew up the First and Second Five Year Development Plans (1951-1956 and 1959-1964), and the Consolidation Plan, which covered the two-year gap between these Plans (1957-1959).Under these Plans the foundations were to be laid for the modernization and industrialization of Ghana.

For the most part, people walked from place to place. There were very few hospitals, schools or clinics.Most of the villageslackeda piped water supply. In fact the nakednessof the land when my government began in 1951has to have been experiencedto be believed. Failure to promote the interests of our people was due to the insatiabledemands of colonialexploitationno longer trust in a broad coalition of interests. The old  civil service and the Judiciary went over almost to a man to  the usurping regime. By so doing they were of course serving  personal interests and to this extent what they did was under\u00ad standable if not excusable. The lesson, however, which their  conduct provides, is that they had no loyalty to the state or  understanding of the social purposes which we were attempt\u00ad ing to achieve. It might be possible to work in the future  with people who were merely dishonest through self-interest  but it is absolutely impossible to utilize a machine which  has shown itself so defective of understanding.  For these reasons, the \"coup\" has achieved something  which it would have been impossible to achieve without  it, namely, a complete and public exposure of the impossibility  of continuing along old lines.  The slate has been wiped clean and now at least we  can begin to build again upon new foundations. For the  people of Ghana life under the \"N.L.C.\" is a form of political  education which they could never otherwise have had. For  the C.P.P. it is an even more important lesson in that it shows  that the old organisation was defective and that the old  leadership in many cases which was inherited from the  struggle against British imperialism was inadequate for its  task and when put to the test of crisis failed.  In the old days popular opinion forced me to maintain  in positions of authority individuals who were well-known  in their localities through their local families and tribal  infl uences. In the past many such people rendered impor\u00ad tant services to the Party. Now, however, a new testing time  has arisen and these people, when weighed against events,  have had all the defects of their characters exposed for the  whole world to see.  In a larger sense the \"coup d'etat\" has made it plain that the  C.P.P. can no longer follow the path of the old line. It must  develop a new and reformed revolutionary leadership which  must come from the broad mass of the Partythe adoption of socialist policies, since in the African situation  genuine independence is incompatible with capitalism; while  the latter involved us in actively suppor ting the liberation and  unity movements in Africa. In both these tasks, my govern\u00ad ment immediately came up against opposition from the same  quarters as before, that is, from reactionary bour geois ele \u00ad ments inside Ghana, and from imperialist and neo-colonialist  interests outside. As before, these forces had a common inter\u00ad est; both wished to delay economic independence and to  impede the progress of the African revolution. The tactics they  employed were sui tably adju sted to the new situation.  After 19 57, having been repeatedly rejected by the elector\u00ad ate, the opposition lost hope of gaining office by constitutional  means, and embarked on a campaign of obstructing the work  of government without making any attempt to devise an al ter\u00ad native programme. They asserted themselves outside the  democratic framework. Their policies, always regional in con\u00ad cept, became purely destruc tive, subversive and violent. Before  independence they had been prepared to sacrifice our national  liberation in order to keep me and my colleagues out of  government; now they were ready to sabotage our newly-born  freedom and to hold up the African revolution by al lying  themselves even more closely with imperialists and the insidi\u00ad ous forces of neo-colonialism in causing a breakdown in  administration so that they might get a chance to grasp the  reins of office.  They employed every stratagem, from demanding the virtual  secession of Ashanti, the Northern Region and Togoland  from the sphere of Central Ghanaian authority, to a press cam\u00ad paign of abuse and lies to dis credit me and the government.  When this failed, they resorted to violence, assassination plots,  and eventually to the subversion of army and police officers.  For a time after 19 57 we tole rated the excesses of the  opposition, but when their actions began to undermine the  state and to jeopardise its independence we took measures,  like all governments do in times of national emergency, to  ensure the security of the nation. For example, we brought in  the Avoidance of Discrimination Bill to deal with the control  of political parties based on tribal and religious affiliations6  SET BACK  The counter-revolutionary nature of the military-police  regime in Ghana became obvious within hours of its establish\u00ad ment. Steps were taken immediately by the \"N.L.C.\" to  destroy our socialist gains and achievements, and to end  Ghana's active participation in the African Revolution. In  other words, we were to witness the all too familiar pattern  and techniques of an imperialist and neo-colonialist attack,  through a puppet government, on both socialism and the  African continental struggle for liberation and unity.  One of the first acts of the \"N.L.C.\" was to announce the  abandonment of the Seven Year Development Plan. Work was  stopped on state enterprises and industries and they were  offered for sale to private investors. Ghana was thrown wide  open, as in colonial days, to all the foreign exploitation we had  worked so hard to end. The imperialist press, reflecting the  jubilation in government circles in Washington, London,  Bonn, Salisbury and Johannesburg, displayed such headings  as: \"Ghana Swings to the West,\" \"The New Ghana Moves  Westwards,\" and \"Ghana Comes to Heel.\" Ghana was being  sold into political and economic slavery. Her image in Africa  and the world was being destroyed and the drive towards an  All-African Union Government set back.  It is significant that Major-General Sir Edward Spears,  Chairman of Ashanti Goldfields, was among the first to con\u00ad gratulate the military and police traitors. He had accepted the  hospitality of my government for the inauguration of the Volta  River Project and was still in Ghana when the action took  place. He at once sent a message to the \"N.L.C.,\" requesting  an interview \"at 7 p.m. on Thursday, March 3rd\". He was  immediately given the appointment he had asked for. Spears  must have been very sure of his ground. It is hardly customary  97. Even more harmful to the economy was another type of enterprise in which some Ghanaians had been participating. This was the setting up of ~JS agcnci\u00a7 for foreign companies which were in fact nothingmore than organizations for distributing bribes and for exerting improper pressures on behalf of foreign companies. The government intended to carry out a thorough investigation into the activities of these agencies and to suppress them. The initiative of Ghanaian businessmen would not be cramped, but we intended to take steps to see that it was channelled towards desirable social ends and was not expended in the exploitation of the community. We would discourage anything which threatened our socialist objectives. For this reason, no Ghanaian would be allowed to take up shares in any enterprise under foreign investment. Instead, our people would be encouraged to save by investing in the state sector and in co-operative undertakings. This, in essence, was our Seven Year Development Plan, a Plan scientifically worked out with the participation of some of the world's leading experts on economic and social planning. It was to ~tegrate educational industrial and agricultural programmes to bong full employm~ and to make possible the achievement of economic independence and a big rise in our living standards: And this was the Plan the rebel military regime scrapped as soon as It usurped power \u2022 No possible justification can be given for its abandonment and the sell-out of Ghana's increasing assets. The first phase of the Plan was going well, and according to schedule. During the first year, \u00a348,900,000 was spent on development projects, and of ~ amount, \u00a316 million went into the key sectors, agriculture and mdustry. In agriculture, the emphasis was on diversification. State farms cultiva- ted 24,000 acres of rubber, oil palm, banana, urena, lobata, coconut and citrus. Together with the agricultural wing of the Workers Brigade, which alone had 12,500 acres, the two institutions cultivated large areas for cereals and vegetables. During this period also, improvements were made in the modernization and productivity of private and co-operative farms. In the industrial sphere, during this period, nearly all the initiative was in the public sector",
        "response": "According to the context, the coup had a significantly negative impact on Ghana's development. As stated, \"The counter-revolutionary nature of the military-police regime in Ghana became obvious within hours of its establishment. Steps were taken immediately by the 'N.L.C.' to destroy our socialist gains and achievements, and to end Ghana's active participation in the African Revolution.\" \n\nThe context further explains that one of the first acts of the \"N.L.C.\" was to announce the abandonment of the Seven Year Development Plan, which was \"scientifically worked out with the participation of some of the world's leading experts on economic and social planning\" to integrate educational, industrial, and agricultural programs, achieve full employment, and make possible the attainment of economic independence and a significant rise in living standards.\n\nThe coup led to the stoppage of work on state enterprises and industries, which were then offered for sale to private investors, thereby opening Ghana up to foreign exploitation once again. The context states, \"Ghana was thrown wide open, as in colonial days, to all the foreign exploitation we had worked so hard to end.\" \n\nAdditionally, the context notes that the first phase of the Seven Year Development Plan was going well and according to schedule, with \u00a348,900,000 spent on development projects in the first year, and significant progress made in agriculture and industry. However, the coup brought all this to a halt, resulting in a significant setback to Ghana's development. \n\nAs Kwame Nkrumah puts it, \"The Ghanaian, who was before a proud African, courageous and with head held high, today appears head-bowed as a collaborator with neo-colonialists. He is suffering as a result of the shame that has been brought on Ghana by the imperialist-inspired coup of February 24th, 1966.\"",

        "question": "How did the coup affect Ghana's development?",
        "context": ". Our national assets had never stood so high. We had laid the infra- structure for the development of Ghana into a modem, industrial state. Our real wealth - our roads, communications, Tema harbour the Volta River Project, our educational and public health systems, our factories, state corporations, hotels and public buildings - was reflected in actual achievement and in productive potential. Economic experts the world over, unless the tools of vested com- mercial interests, acknowledged that the progress we had made in Ghana was amazing and beyond what even the most optimistic had believed possible. But for the treachery of the NLC, the whole of Ghana would by now have been electrified. Industrialization would have taken place not only in the South, but in every region including the far North. Every town and village would have had ample electricity and piped water. There would have been further expansion of both the health and education services. There would have been a tremendous increase in food production. We had developed plans for the vast grasslands of the North. Only days before the 'coup', I had signed a contract for the irrigation and agricultural development of the Accra plains. Our scheme to create an inland fishing industry and inland water transport on the Volta Lake was near to operation. We were waiting only for the water to rise. All these schemes, and they were nation-wide, would have required the active participation of tens of thousands more of our people. Every young man and woman was needed as soon as he or she had completed the necessary education. How criminal that our resources of people and materials should now be wasted in mass unemploy- ment, and that our immense productive potential should be put at the disposal of neo-colonialists serving their own selfish interests. The Ghanaian, who was before a proud African, courageous and with head held high, today appears head-bowed as a collaborator with neo-colonialists. He is suffering as a result of the shame that has been brought on Ghana by the imperialist-inspired coup of February 24th, 1966. Ghana, under my government, was a haven for the oppressed from all parts of Africaof our development plans and of their implementation reveals  the truth-that it was their success and not their failure which  spurred our enemies into action. Ghana, on the threshold of  economic independence, and in the vanguard of the African  revolutionary struggle to achieve continental liberation and  unity, was too dangerous an example to the rest of Africa to  be allowed to continue under a socialist-directed government.  In the first ten years of its administration, the Ghana gov\u00ad ernment drew up the First and Second Five Year Development  Plans (19 51-19 56 and 19 59-1 964), and the Consolidation Plan,  which covered the two-year gap between these Plans (1 957- 19 59). Under these Plans the foundations were to be laid for  the modernisation and industrialisation of Ghana. A skilled  labour force was to be trained and an adequate complement  of public services built up such as transport, electricity, water  and telecommunications.  We had to work fast. Under colonial rule, foreign monopoly  interests had tied up our whole economy to suit themselves.  We had not a single industry. Our economy was dependent on  one cash crop--cocoa. Although our output of cocoa is the  largest in the world, there was not a single cocoa processing  factory.  Before we took office in 1951 there was no direct railway  between Accra and Takoradi, in those days our main port.  Passengers and freight had to travel by way of Kumasi. This  was because Kumasi was the centre of the timber and mining  ind ustries, both of which served foreign interests and were  therefore well supplied with the necessary communications.  There were few roads, and only a very rudimentary public  transport system. For the most part, people walked from place  to place. There were very few hospitals, schools or clinics.  Most of our villages lacked a piped water supply. In fact, the  nakedness of the land when my government began in 1951 has  to have been experienced to be believed.  Failure to promote the interests of our people was due to the  insatiable demands of colonial exploitationindependence - real economic independence. The 'NLC' replaced it with a two-year 'review period' during which the socialized industries would be dismantled and the door opened once more to unrestricted 'private enterprise' - in fact, they were establishing a neo-colonialist economic subjugation of Ghana. The only Ghanaians to benefit from such a sell-out were the African middle-class hangers-on to noo-colonialist privilege and the neo-colonialist trading firms. For the mass of workers, peasants and farmers, the victims of the capitalist free-for-all, it meant a return to the position of 'drawers of water and hewers of wood' to Western capitalism. Of course, the Ghanaian economy was not without its problems, but is this not true of all national economies, and particularly those of developing countries in the context of the growing gap between rich and poor nations? In any event, these difficulties were not determinant. It was no mean achievement that in January 1965, after five years as a Republic, Ghana had 63 state enterprises and a budget of \u00a3200 million, including a supplementary budget, for its population of nearly eight million; while Nigeria, richer in national resources and with a population of 55 million, had a budget of \u00a378 million. Imperialist circles have talked much about Ghana's external debt, given as \u00a3250 million. Apart from the dubious accounting which arrived at this conveniently round sum, a figure such as this means nothing unless it is set in the context of the overall Ghanaian econo- mic situation. To implement our various Development Plans it was necessary to borrow considerable sums of money, but it was borrowed on the basis of building capital assets such as the Volta dam, and over 100 industries established in Ghana since indepen- dence. The government made sure that the international agreements signed were based on economic feasibility, and that the money borrowed could create something lasting and beneficial not only for us in our lifetime but for the generations to follow. Seen in the light of Ghana's growing industries and increasing exports, her 'indebted- ness' is put in proper perspective - as an index of the investors' confi- dence in the enterprise and the management they helped to financesocialism, which were published and circulated freely in  Britain, were banned in the British colonial empire, and after  Ghana became independent it was assumed abroad that it  would continue to follow the same restrictive ideological  approach. When we behaved as did the British in their rela\u00ad tions with the socialist countries we were accused of being  pro-R ussian and introd ucing the most dangerous ideas into  Africa.  In fact, the fault was that, from the very circumstances  in which we found ourselves , we were unable to introduce  more \"dangerous ideas\" or to get them more widely under\u00ad stood. What went wrong in Ghana was not that we attempted  to have friendly relations with the countries of the socialist  world but that we maintained too friendly relations with  the countries of the western bloc.  Before the military revolt the policy of Ghana was based  upon an attempt to develop the country along what were  essentially socialist lines. This policy could have succeeded  had the western world been prepared to see coming into  existence a genuinely independent African state. In fact,  they were not prepared to do so and we thus gave innumer\u00ad able hostages to fortune.  The \"coup d'etat\" on its surface was a military revolt  against myself and what I stood for. If it is analysed more  deeply, however, it is a mark of the breakdown of the western  attempt to influence and control Africa. The western coun\u00ad tries, having failed to control democratically supported Afri\u00ad can governments, were forced into the final extremity of  substituting regimes which depended upon no other mandate  than the weapons which they held in their hands. Such puppet  governments cannot survive for long either in Ghana or else\u00ad where in Africa. They are, in the first place, based on internal  contradictions. Why they are tolerated is that their initial  popularity is due to a sort of sympathetic magic. The pros\u00ad perity of the western world at the moment depends upon  exploiting less developed countries. Each year the western  world pays less for its imports and each year charges more  for its exportsREPERCUSSIONS  The position of the \"N.L.C.\", always precarious, has been  made even more shaky by the attitude of the progressive inde\u00ad pendent states of Africa. and the exposure of the so-called  \"coup\" as counter-r evolutionary and reactionary.  As soon as the army and police traitors seized power in my  absence from Ghana, repercussions in the rest of Africa, and  overseas, showed that there was a full awareness of the under\u00ad lying political implications. Through all the smoke- screen of  lies and propaganda, the action was clearly recognised as a  blow struck by imperialists ond neo-colonialists and their  agents against socialism and the African Revolution. The  taking sides \"for\" and \"against\" showed once again the famil\u00ad iar groupings of-on the one side, those who are struggling to  achieve socialism and the total liberation and unity of the  African continent, and on the other, those who want to  maintain the status quo, and are fighting a desperate rearguard  action to halt the liberation movement.  Both sides have regarded Ghana as a key factor in the  struggle. Since independence, Ghana has thrown herself freely  and boldly into the struggle for African emancipation. We  have proclaimed our firm stand against imperialism, coloni\u00ad alism and neo-colonialism. We have unflinchingly stated that  the independence of Ghana is meaningless unless it is  linked up with the total liberation of the African continent.  Before 24th February 1966, Ghana was a haven to which  the oppressed from all parts of Africa could come to carry on  their struggle. Freedom fighters and political refugees from  South Africa, Rhodesia, Mozambique, Angola, so-called Por\u00ad tuguese Guinea, the Cape Verde Islands, and other oppressed  colonial areas, were given hospitality and encouragement  amongst us. Ghana was to them a symbol of hope and an  inspiration. It was a centre where they could meet to discuss  common problems. and where they could organise and train.  132.An examinationofour development plans and of their implementationrevealsthe truth - that it was their success, and not their failure which spurred our enemiesinto action. Ghana, on the threshold of economicindependence, and in the vanguard of the African revolutionary struggle to achieve continental liberation and unity, wastoo dangerous an exampleto the rest of Africa to be allowedto continue under a socialist-directed government. In the first ten years of its administration, the Ghana government drew up the First and Second Five Year Development Plans (1951-1956 and 1959-1964), and the Consolidation Plan, which covered the two-year gap between these Plans (1957-1959).Under these Plans the foundations were to be laid for the modernization and industrialization of Ghana.

In fact the nakednessof the land when my government began in 1951has to have been experiencedto be believed. Failure to promote the interests of our people was due to the insatiabledemands of colonialexploitationno longer trust in a broad coalition of interests. The old  civil service and the Judiciary went over almost to a man to  the usurping regime. By so doing they were of course serving  personal interests and to this extent what they did was under\u00ad standable if not excusable. The lesson, however, which their  conduct provides, is that they had no loyalty to the state or  understanding of the social purposes which we were attempt\u00ad ing to achieve. It might be possible to work in the future  with people who were merely dishonest through self-interest  but it is absolutely impossible to utilize a machine which  has shown itself so defective of understanding.  For these reasons, the \"coup\" has achieved something  which it would have been impossible to achieve without  it, namely, a complete and public exposure of the impossibility  of continuing along old lines.  The slate has been wiped clean and now at least we  can begin to build again upon new foundations. For the  people of Ghana life under the \"N.L.C.\" is a form of political  education which they could never otherwise have had. For  the C.P.P. it is an even more important lesson in that it shows  that the old organisation was defective and that the old  leadership in many cases which was inherited from the  struggle against British imperialism was inadequate for its  task and when put to the test of crisis failed.  In the old days popular opinion forced me to maintain  in positions of authority individuals who were well-known  in their localities through their local families and tribal  infl uences. In the past many such people rendered impor\u00ad tant services to the Party. Now, however, a new testing time  has arisen and these people, when weighed against events,  have had all the defects of their characters exposed for the  whole world to see.  In a larger sense the \"coup d'etat\" has made it plain that the  C.P.P. can no longer follow the path of the old line. It must  develop a new and reformed revolutionary leadership which  must come from the broad mass of the Partythe adoption of socialist policies, since in the African situation  genuine independence is incompatible with capitalism; while  the latter involved us in actively suppor ting the liberation and  unity movements in Africa. In both these tasks, my govern\u00ad ment immediately came up against opposition from the same  quarters as before, that is, from reactionary bour geois ele \u00ad ments inside Ghana, and from imperialist and neo-colonialist  interests outside. As before, these forces had a common inter\u00ad est; both wished to delay economic independence and to  impede the progress of the African revolution. The tactics they  employed were sui tably adju sted to the new situation.  After 19 57, having been repeatedly rejected by the elector\u00ad ate, the opposition lost hope of gaining office by constitutional  means, and embarked on a campaign of obstructing the work  of government without making any attempt to devise an al ter\u00ad native programme. They asserted themselves outside the  democratic framework. Their policies, always regional in con\u00ad cept, became purely destruc tive, subversive and violent. Before  independence they had been prepared to sacrifice our national  liberation in order to keep me and my colleagues out of  government; now they were ready to sabotage our newly-born  freedom and to hold up the African revolution by al lying  themselves even more closely with imperialists and the insidi\u00ad ous forces of neo-colonialism in causing a breakdown in  administration so that they might get a chance to grasp the  reins of office.  They employed every stratagem, from demanding the virtual  secession of Ashanti, the Northern Region and Togoland  from the sphere of Central Ghanaian authority, to a press cam\u00ad paign of abuse and lies to dis credit me and the government.  When this failed, they resorted to violence, assassination plots,  and eventually to the subversion of army and police officers.  For a time after 19 57 we tole rated the excesses of the  opposition, but when their actions began to undermine the  state and to jeopardise its independence we took measures,  like all governments do in times of national emergency, to  ensure the security of the nation. For example, we brought in  the Avoidance of Discrimination Bill to deal with the control  of political parties based on tribal and religious affiliations6  SET BACK  The counter-revolutionary nature of the military-police  regime in Ghana became obvious within hours of its establish\u00ad ment. Steps were taken immediately by the \"N.L.C.\" to  destroy our socialist gains and achievements, and to end  Ghana's active participation in the African Revolution. In  other words, we were to witness the all too familiar pattern  and techniques of an imperialist and neo-colonialist attack,  through a puppet government, on both socialism and the  African continental struggle for liberation and unity.  One of the first acts of the \"N.L.C.\" was to announce the  abandonment of the Seven Year Development Plan. Work was  stopped on state enterprises and industries and they were  offered for sale to private investors. Ghana was thrown wide  open, as in colonial days, to all the foreign exploitation we had  worked so hard to end. The imperialist press, reflecting the  jubilation in government circles in Washington, London,  Bonn, Salisbury and Johannesburg, displayed such headings  as: \"Ghana Swings to the West,\" \"The New Ghana Moves  Westwards,\" and \"Ghana Comes to Heel.\" Ghana was being  sold into political and economic slavery. Her image in Africa  and the world was being destroyed and the drive towards an  All-African Union Government set back.  It is significant that Major-General Sir Edward Spears,  Chairman of Ashanti Goldfields, was among the first to con\u00ad gratulate the military and police traitors. He had accepted the  hospitality of my government for the inauguration of the Volta  River Project and was still in Ghana when the action took  place. He at once sent a message to the \"N.L.C.,\" requesting  an interview \"at 7 p.m. on Thursday, March 3rd\". He was  immediately given the appointment he had asked for. Spears  must have been very sure of his ground. It is hardly customary  97. Even more harmful to the economy was another type of enterprise in which some Ghanaians had been participating. This was the setting up of ~JS agcnci\u00a7 for foreign companies which were in fact nothingmore than organizations for distributing bribes and for exerting improper pressures on behalf of foreign companies. The government intended to carry out a thorough investigation into the activities of these agencies and to suppress them. The initiative of Ghanaian businessmen would not be cramped, but we intended to take steps to see that it was channelled towards desirable social ends and was not expended in the exploitation of the community. We would discourage anything which threatened our socialist objectives. For this reason, no Ghanaian would be allowed to take up shares in any enterprise under foreign investment. Instead, our people would be encouraged to save by investing in the state sector and in co-operative undertakings. This, in essence, was our Seven Year Development Plan, a Plan scientifically worked out with the participation of some of the world's leading experts on economic and social planning. It was to ~tegrate educational industrial and agricultural programmes to bong full employm~ and to make possible the achievement of economic independence and a big rise in our living standards: And this was the Plan the rebel military regime scrapped as soon as It usurped power \u2022 No possible justification can be given for its abandonment and the sell-out of Ghana's increasing assets. The first phase of the Plan was going well, and according to schedule. During the first year, \u00a348,900,000 was spent on development projects, and of ~ amount, \u00a316 million went into the key sectors, agriculture and mdustry. In agriculture, the emphasis was on diversification. State farms cultiva- ted 24,000 acres of rubber, oil palm, banana, urena, lobata, coconut and citrus. Together with the agricultural wing of the Workers Brigade, which alone had 12,500 acres, the two institutions cultivated large areas for cereals and vegetables. During this period also, improvements were made in the modernization and productivity of private and co-operative farms. In the industrial sphere, during this period, nearly all the initiative was in the public sector",

Every young man and woman was needed as soon as he or she had completed the necessary education. How criminal that our resources of people and materials should now be wasted in mass unemploy- ment, and that our immense productive potential should be put at the disposal of neo-colonialists serving their own selfish interests. The Ghanaian, who was before a proud African, courageous and with head held high, today appears head-bowed as a collaborator with neo-colonialists. He is suffering as a result of the shame that has been brought on Ghana by the imperialist-inspired coup of February 24th, 1966.

The only Ghanaians to benefit from such a sell-out were the African middle-class hangers-on to noo-colonialist privilege and the neo-colonialist trading firms. For the mass of workers, peasants and farmers, the victims of the capitalist free-for-all, it meant a return to the position of 'drawers of water and hewers of wood' to Western capitalism. Of course, the Ghanaian economy was not without its problems, but is this not true of all national economies, and particularly those of developing countries in the context of the growing gap between rich and poor nations? In any event, these difficulties were not determinant. It was no mean achievement that in January 1965, after five years as a Republic, Ghana had 63 state enterprises and a budget of \u00a3200 million, including a supplementary budget, for its population of nearly eight million; while Nigeria, richer in national resources and with a population of 55 million, had a budget of \u00a378 million. Imperialist circles have talked much about Ghana's external debt, given as \u00a3250 million. Apart from the dubious accounting which arrived at this conveniently round sum, a figure such as this means nothing unless it is set in the context of the overall Ghanaian econo- mic situation. To implement our various Development Plans it was necessary to borrow considerable sums of money, but it was borrowed on the basis of building capital assets such as the Volta dam, and over 100 industries established in Ghana since indepen- dence. The government made sure that the international agreements signed were based on economic feasibility, and that the money borrowed could create something lasting and beneficial not only for us in our lifetime but for the generations to follow.

In fact, the fault was that, from the very circumstances  in which we found ourselves , we were unable to introduce  more \"dangerous ideas\" or to get them more widely under\u00ad stood. What went wrong in Ghana was not that we attempted  to have friendly relations with the countries of the socialist  world but that we maintained too friendly relations with  the countries of the western bloc.  Before the military revolt the policy of Ghana was based  upon an attempt to develop the country along what were  essentially socialist lines. This policy could have succeeded  had the western world been prepared to see coming into  existence a genuinely independent African state. In fact,  they were not prepared to do so and we thus gave innumer\u00ad able hostages to fortune.  The \"coup d'etat\" on its surface was a military revolt  against myself and what I stood for. If it is analysed more  deeply, however, it is a mark of the breakdown of the western  attempt to influence and control Africa. The western coun\u00ad tries, having failed to control democratically supported Afri\u00ad can governments, were forced into the final extremity of  substituting regimes which depended upon no other mandate  than the weapons which they held in their hands. Such puppet  governments cannot survive for long either in Ghana or else\u00ad where in Africa. They are, in the first place, based on internal  contradictions. Why they are tolerated is that their initial  popularity is due to a sort of sympathetic magic. The pros\u00ad perity of the western world at the moment depends upon  exploiting less developed countries. Each year the western  world pays less for its imports and each year charges more  for its exportsREPERCUSSIONS  The position of the \"N.L.C.\", always precarious, has been  made even more shaky by the attitude of the progressive inde\u00ad pendent states of Africa. and the exposure of the so-called  \"coup\" as counter-r evolutionary and reactionary.  As soon as the army and police traitors seized power in my  absence from Ghana, repercussions in the rest of Africa, and  overseas, showed that there was a full awareness of the under\u00ad lying political implications. Through all the smoke- screen of  lies and propaganda, the action was clearly recognised as a  blow struck by imperialists ond neo-colonialists and their  agents against socialism and the African Revolution. The  taking sides \"for\" and \"against\" showed once again the famil\u00ad iar groupings of-on the one side, those who are struggling to  achieve socialism and the total liberation and unity of the  African continent, and on the other, those who want to  maintain the status quo, and are fighting a desperate rearguard  action to halt the liberation movement.  Both sides have regarded Ghana as a key factor in the  struggle. Since independence, Ghana has thrown herself freely  and boldly into the struggle for African emancipation. We  have proclaimed our firm stand against imperialism, coloni\u00ad alism and neo-colonialism. We have unflinchingly stated that  the independence of Ghana is meaningless unless it is  linked up with the total liberation of the African continent.  Before 24th February 1966, Ghana was a haven to which  the oppressed from all parts of Africa could come to carry on  their struggle. Freedom fighters and political refugees from  South Africa, Rhodesia, Mozambique, Angola, so-called Por\u00ad tuguese Guinea, the Cape Verde Islands, and other oppressed  colonial areas, were given hospitality and encouragement  amongst us. Ghana was to them a symbol of hope and an  inspiration. It was a centre where they could meet to discuss  common problems. and where they could organise and train.  132.An examinationofour development plans and of their implementationrevealsthe truth - that it was their success, and not their failure which spurred our enemiesinto action.

The old  civil service and the Judiciary went over almost to a man to  the usurping regime. By so doing they were of course serving  personal interests and to this extent what they did was under\u00ad standable if not excusable. The lesson, however, which their  conduct provides, is that they had no loyalty to the state or  understanding of the social purposes which we were attempt\u00ad ing to achieve. It might be possible to work in the future  with people who were merely dishonest through self-interest  but it is absolutely impossible to utilize a machine which  has shown itself so defective of understanding.  For these reasons, the \"coup\" has achieved something  which it would have been impossible to achieve without  it, namely, a complete and public exposure of the impossibility  of continuing along old lines.  The slate has been wiped clean and now at least we  can begin to build again upon new foundations. For the  people of Ghana life under the \"N.L.C.\" is a form of political  education which they could never otherwise have had. For  the C.P.P. it is an even more important lesson in that it shows  that the old organisation was defective and that the old  leadership in many cases which was inherited from the  struggle against British imperialism was inadequate for its  task and when put to the test of crisis failed.  In the old days popular opinion forced me to maintain  in positions of authority individuals who were well-known  in their localities through their local families and tribal  infl uences. In the past many such people rendered impor\u00ad tant services to the Party. Now, however, a new testing time  has arisen and these people, when weighed against events,  have had all the defects of their characters exposed for the  whole world to see.  In a larger sense the \"coup d'etat\" has made it plain that the  C.P.P. can no longer follow the path of the old line. It must  develop a new and reformed revolutionary leadership which  must come from the broad mass of the Partythe adoption of socialist policies, since in the African situation  genuine independence is incompatible with capitalism; while  the latter involved us in actively suppor ting the liberation and  unity movements in Africa. In both these tasks, my govern\u00ad ment immediately came up against opposition from the same  quarters as before, that is, from reactionary bour geois ele \u00ad ments inside Ghana, and from imperialist and neo-colonialist  interests outside. As before, these forces had a common inter\u00ad est; both wished to delay economic independence and to  impede the progress of the African revolution. The tactics they  employed were sui tably adju sted to the new situation.  After 19 57, having been repeatedly rejected by the elector\u00ad ate, the opposition lost hope of gaining office by constitutional  means, and embarked on a campaign of obstructing the work  of government without making any attempt to devise an al ter\u00ad native programme. They asserted themselves outside the  democratic framework. Their policies, always regional in con\u00ad cept, became purely destruc tive, subversive and violent. Before  independence they had been prepared to sacrifice our national  liberation in order to keep me and my colleagues out of  government; now they were ready to sabotage our newly-born  freedom and to hold up the African revolution by al lying  themselves even more closely with imperialists and the insidi\u00ad ous forces of neo-colonialism in causing a breakdown in  administration so that they might get a chance to grasp the  reins of office.  They employed every stratagem, from demanding the virtual  secession of Ashanti, the Northern Region and Togoland  from the sphere of Central Ghanaian authority, to a press cam\u00ad paign of abuse and lies to dis credit me and the government.  When this failed, they resorted to violence, assassination plots,  and eventually to the subversion of army and police officers.  For a time after 19 57 we tole rated the excesses of the  opposition, but when their actions began to undermine the  state and to jeopardise its independence we took measures,  like all governments do in times of national emergency, to  ensure the security of the nation. For example, we brought in  the Avoidance of Discrimination Bill to deal with the control  of political parties based on tribal and religious affiliations6  SET BACK  The counter-revolutionary nature of the military-police  regime in Ghana became obvious within hours of its establish\u00ad ment. Steps were taken immediately by the \"N.L.C.\" to  destroy our socialist gains and achievements, and to end  Ghana's active participation in the African Revolution. In  other words, we were to witness the all too familiar pattern  and techniques of an imperialist and neo-colonialist attack,  through a puppet government, on both socialism and the  African continental struggle for liberation and unity.  One of the first acts of the \"N.L.C.\" was to announce the  abandonment of the Seven Year Development Plan. Work was  stopped on state enterprises and industries and they were  offered for sale to private investors. Ghana was thrown wide  open, as in colonial days, to all the foreign exploitation we had  worked so hard to end. The imperialist press, reflecting the  jubilation in government circles in Washington, London,  Bonn, Salisbury and Johannesburg, displayed such headings  as: \"Ghana Swings to the West,\" \"The New Ghana Moves  Westwards,\" and \"Ghana Comes to Heel.\" Ghana was being  sold into political and economic slavery. Her image in Africa  and the world was being destroyed and the drive towards an  All-African Union Government set back.  It is significant that Major-General Sir Edward Spears,  Chairman of Ashanti Goldfields, was among the first to con\u00ad gratulate the military and police traitors. He had accepted the  hospitality of my government for the inauguration of the Volta  River Project and was still in Ghana when the action took  place. He at once sent a message to the \"N.L.C.,\" requesting  an interview \"at 7 p.m. on Thursday, March 3rd\". He was  immediately given the appointment he had asked for. Spears  must have been very sure of his ground. It is hardly customary  97. Even more harmful to the economy was another type of enterprise in which some Ghanaians had been participating. This was the setting up of ~JS agcnci\u00a7 for foreign companies which were in fact nothingmore than organizations for distributing bribes and for exerting improper pressures on behalf of foreign companies. The government intended to carry out a thorough investigation into the activities of these agencies and to suppress them. The initiative of Ghanaian businessmen would not be cramped, but we intended to take steps to see that it was channelled towards desirable social ends and was not expended in the exploitation of the community. We would discourage anything which threatened our socialist objectives. For this reason, no Ghanaian would be allowed to take up shares in any enterprise under foreign investment. Instead, our people would be encouraged to save by investing in the state sector and in co-operative undertakings. This, in essence, was our Seven Year Development Plan, a Plan scientifically worked out with the participation of some of the world's leading experts on economic and social planning. It was to ~tegrate educational industrial and agricultural programmes to bong full employm~ and to make possible the achievement of economic independence and a big rise in our living standards: And this was the Plan the rebel military regime scrapped as soon as It usurped power \u2022 No possible justification can be given for its abandonment and the sell-out of Ghana's increasing assets. The first phase of the Plan was going well, and according to schedule. During the first year, \u00a348,900,000 was spent on development projects, and of ~ amount, \u00a316 million went into the key sectors, agriculture and mdustry. In agriculture, the emphasis was on diversification. State farms cultiva- ted 24,000 acres of rubber, oil palm, banana, urena, lobata, coconut and citrus. Together with the agricultural wing of the Workers Brigade, which alone had 12,500 acres, the two institutions cultivated large areas for cereals and vegetables. During this period also, improvements were made in the modernization and productivity of private and co-operative farms. In the industrial sphere, during this period, nearly all the initiative was in the public sector",

        "question": "How did the coup affect Ghana's development?",
        "context": ". Our national assets had never stood so high. We had laid the infra- structure for the development of Ghana into a modem, industrial state. Our real wealth - our roads, communications, Tema harbour the Volta River Project, our educational and public health systems, our factories, state corporations, hotels and public buildings - was reflected in actual achievement and in productive potential. Economic experts the world over, unless the tools of vested com- mercial interests, acknowledged that the progress we had made in Ghana was amazing and beyond what even the most optimistic had believed possible. But for the treachery of the NLC, the whole of Ghana would by now have been electrified. Industrialization would have taken place not only in the South, but in every region including the far North. Every town and village would have had ample electricity and piped water. There would have been further expansion of both the health and education services. There would have been a tremendous increase in food production. We had developed plans for the vast grasslands of the North. Only days before the 'coup', I had signed a contract for the irrigation and agricultural development of the Accra plains. Our scheme to create an inland fishing industry and inland water transport on the Volta Lake was near to operation. We were waiting only for the water to rise. All these schemes, and they were nation-wide, would have required the active participation of tens of thousands more of our people. Every young man and woman was needed as soon as he or she had completed the necessary education. How criminal that our resources of people and materials should now be wasted in mass unemploy- ment, and that our immense productive potential should be put at the disposal of neo-colonialists serving their own selfish interests. The Ghanaian, who was before a proud African, courageous and with head held high, today appears head-bowed as a collaborator with neo-colonialists. He is suffering as a result of the shame that has been brought on Ghana by the imperialist-inspired coup of February 24th, 1966. Ghana, under my government, was a haven for the oppressed from all parts of Africaof our development plans and of their implementation reveals  the truth-that it was their success and not their failure which  spurred our enemies into action. Ghana, on the threshold of  economic independence, and in the vanguard of the African  revolutionary struggle to achieve continental liberation and  unity, was too dangerous an example to the rest of Africa to  be allowed to continue under a socialist-directed government.  In the first ten years of its administration, the Ghana gov\u00ad ernment drew up the First and Second Five Year Development  Plans (19 51-19 56 and 19 59-1 964), and the Consolidation Plan,  which covered the two-year gap between these Plans (1 957- 19 59). Under these Plans the foundations were to be laid for  the modernisation and industrialisation of Ghana. A skilled  labour force was to be trained and an adequate complement  of public services built up such as transport, electricity, water  and telecommunications.  We had to work fast. Under colonial rule, foreign monopoly  interests had tied up our whole economy to suit themselves.  We had not a single industry. Our economy was dependent on  one cash crop--cocoa. Although our output of cocoa is the  largest in the world, there was not a single cocoa processing  factory.  Before we took office in 1951 there was no direct railway  between Accra and Takoradi, in those days our main port.  Passengers and freight had to travel by way of Kumasi. This  was because Kumasi was the centre of the timber and mining  ind ustries, both of which served foreign interests and were  therefore well supplied with the necessary communications.  There were few roads, and only a very rudimentary public  transport system. For the most part, people walked from place  to place. There were very few hospitals, schools or clinics.  Most of our villages lacked a piped water supply. In fact, the  nakedness of the land when my government began in 1951 has  to have been experienced to be believed.  Failure to promote the interests of our people was due to the  insatiable demands of colonial exploitationindependence - real economic independence. The 'NLC' replaced it with a two-year 'review period' during which the socialized industries would be dismantled and the door opened once more to unrestricted 'private enterprise' - in fact, they were establishing a neo-colonialist economic subjugation of Ghana. The only Ghanaians to benefit from such a sell-out were the African middle-class hangers-on to noo-colonialist privilege and the neo-colonialist trading firms. For the mass of workers, peasants and farmers, the victims of the capitalist free-for-all, it meant a return to the position of 'drawers of water and hewers of wood' to Western capitalism. Of course, the Ghanaian economy was not without its problems, but is this not true of all national economies, and particularly those of developing countries in the context of the growing gap between rich and poor nations? In any event, these difficulties were not determinant. It was no mean achievement that in January 1965, after five years as a Republic, Ghana had 63 state enterprises and a budget of \u00a3200 million, including a supplementary budget, for its population of nearly eight million; while Nigeria, richer in national resources and with a population of 55 million, had a budget of \u00a378 million. Imperialist circles have talked much about Ghana's external debt, given as \u00a3250 million. Apart from the dubious accounting which arrived at this conveniently round sum, a figure such as this means nothing unless it is set in the context of the overall Ghanaian econo- mic situation. To implement our various Development Plans it was necessary to borrow considerable sums of money, but it was borrowed on the basis of building capital assets such as the Volta dam, and over 100 industries established in Ghana since indepen- dence. The government made sure that the international agreements signed were based on economic feasibility, and that the money borrowed could create something lasting and beneficial not only for us in our lifetime but for the generations to follow. Seen in the light of Ghana's growing industries and increasing exports, her 'indebted- ness' is put in proper perspective - as an index of the investors' confi- dence in the enterprise and the management they helped to financesocialism, which were published and circulated freely in  Britain, were banned in the British colonial empire, and after  Ghana became independent it was assumed abroad that it  would continue to follow the same restrictive ideological  approach. When we behaved as did the British in their rela\u00ad tions with the socialist countries we were accused of being  pro-R ussian and introd ucing the most dangerous ideas into  Africa.  In fact, the fault was that, from the very circumstances  in which we found ourselves , we were unable to introduce  more \"dangerous ideas\" or to get them more widely under\u00ad stood. What went wrong in Ghana was not that we attempted  to have friendly relations with the countries of the socialist  world but that we maintained too friendly relations with  the countries of the western bloc.  Before the military revolt the policy of Ghana was based  upon an attempt to develop the country along what were  essentially socialist lines. This policy could have succeeded  had the western world been prepared to see coming into  existence a genuinely independent African state. In fact,  they were not prepared to do so and we thus gave innumer\u00ad able hostages to fortune.  The \"coup d'etat\" on its surface was a military revolt  against myself and what I stood for. If it is analysed more  deeply, however, it is a mark of the breakdown of the western  attempt to influence and control Africa. The western coun\u00ad tries, having failed to control democratically supported Afri\u00ad can governments, were forced into the final extremity of  substituting regimes which depended upon no other mandate  than the weapons which they held in their hands. Such puppet  governments cannot survive for long either in Ghana or else\u00ad where in Africa. They are, in the first place, based on internal  contradictions. Why they are tolerated is that their initial  popularity is due to a sort of sympathetic magic. The pros\u00ad perity of the western world at the moment depends upon  exploiting less developed countries. Each year the western  world pays less for its imports and each year charges more  for its exportsREPERCUSSIONS  The position of the \"N.L.C.\", always precarious, has been  made even more shaky by the attitude of the progressive inde\u00ad pendent states of Africa. and the exposure of the so-called  \"coup\" as counter-r evolutionary and reactionary.  As soon as the army and police traitors seized power in my  absence from Ghana, repercussions in the rest of Africa, and  overseas, showed that there was a full awareness of the under\u00ad lying political implications. Through all the smoke- screen of  lies and propaganda, the action was clearly recognised as a  blow struck by imperialists ond neo-colonialists and their  agents against socialism and the African Revolution. The  taking sides \"for\" and \"against\" showed once again the famil\u00ad iar groupings of-on the one side, those who are struggling to  achieve socialism and the total liberation and unity of the  African continent, and on the other, those who want to  maintain the status quo, and are fighting a desperate rearguard  action to halt the liberation movement.  Both sides have regarded Ghana as a key factor in the  struggle. Since independence, Ghana has thrown herself freely  and boldly into the struggle for African emancipation. We  have proclaimed our firm stand against imperialism, coloni\u00ad alism and neo-colonialism. We have unflinchingly stated that  the independence of Ghana is meaningless unless it is  linked up with the total liberation of the African continent.  Before 24th February 1966, Ghana was a haven to which  the oppressed from all parts of Africa could come to carry on  their struggle. Freedom fighters and political refugees from  South Africa, Rhodesia, Mozambique, Angola, so-called Por\u00ad tuguese Guinea, the Cape Verde Islands, and other oppressed  colonial areas, were given hospitality and encouragement  amongst us. Ghana was to them a symbol of hope and an  inspiration. It was a centre where they could meet to discuss  common problems. and where they could organise and train.  132.An examinationofour development plans and of their implementationrevealsthe truth - that it was their success, and not their failure which spurred our enemiesinto action. Ghana, on the threshold of economicindependence, and in the vanguard of the African revolutionary struggle to achieve continental liberation and unity, wastoo dangerous an exampleto the rest of Africa to be allowedto continue under a socialist-directed government. In the first ten years of its administration, the Ghana government drew up the First and Second Five Year Development Plans (1951-1956 and 1959-1964), and the Consolidation Plan, which covered the two-year gap between these Plans (1957-1959).Under these Plans the foundations were to be laid for the modernization and industrialization of Ghana.

For the most part, people walked from place to place. There were very few hospitals, schools or clinics.Most of the villageslackeda piped water supply. In fact the nakednessof the land when my government began in 1951has to have been experiencedto be believed. Failure to promote the interests of our people was due to the insatiabledemands of colonialexploitationno longer trust in a broad coalition of interests. The old  civil service and the Judiciary went over almost to a man to  the usurping regime. By so doing they were of course serving  personal interests and to this extent what they did was under\u00ad standable if not excusable. The lesson, however, which their  conduct provides, is that they had no loyalty to the state or  understanding of the social purposes which we were attempt\u00ad ing to achieve. It might be possible to work in the future  with people who were merely dishonest through self-interest  but it is absolutely impossible to utilize a machine which  has shown itself so defective of understanding.  For these reasons, the \"coup\" has achieved something  which it would have been impossible to achieve without  it, namely, a complete and public exposure of the impossibility  of continuing along old lines.  The slate has been wiped clean and now at least we  can begin to build again upon new foundations. For the  people of Ghana life under the \"N.L.C.\" is a form of political  education which they could never otherwise have had. For  the C.P.P. it is an even more important lesson in that it shows  that the old organisation was defective and that the old  leadership in many cases which was inherited from the  struggle against British imperialism was inadequate for its  task and when put to the test of crisis failed.  In the old days popular opinion forced me to maintain  in positions of authority individuals who were well-known  in their localities through their local families and tribal  infl uences. In the past many such people rendered impor\u00ad tant services to the Party. Now, however, a new testing time  has arisen and these people, when weighed against events,  have had all the defects of their characters exposed for the  whole world to see.  In a larger sense the \"coup d'etat\" has made it plain that the  C.P.P. can no longer follow the path of the old line. It must  develop a new and reformed revolutionary leadership which  must come from the broad mass of the Partythe adoption of socialist policies, since in the African situation  genuine independence is incompatible with capitalism; while  the latter involved us in actively suppor ting the liberation and  unity movements in Africa. In both these tasks, my govern\u00ad ment immediately came up against opposition from the same  quarters as before, that is, from reactionary bour geois ele \u00ad ments inside Ghana, and from imperialist and neo-colonialist  interests outside. As before, these forces had a common inter\u00ad est; both wished to delay economic independence and to  impede the progress of the African revolution. The tactics they  employed were sui tably adju sted to the new situation.  After 19 57, having been repeatedly rejected by the elector\u00ad ate, the opposition lost hope of gaining office by constitutional  means, and embarked on a campaign of obstructing the work  of government without making any attempt to devise an al ter\u00ad native programme. They asserted themselves outside the  democratic framework. Their policies, always regional in con\u00ad cept, became purely destruc tive, subversive and violent. Before  independence they had been prepared to sacrifice our national  liberation in order to keep me and my colleagues out of  government; now they were ready to sabotage our newly-born  freedom and to hold up the African revolution by al lying  themselves even more closely with imperialists and the insidi\u00ad ous forces of neo-colonialism in causing a breakdown in  administration so that they might get a chance to grasp the  reins of office.  They employed every stratagem, from demanding the virtual  secession of Ashanti, the Northern Region and Togoland  from the sphere of Central Ghanaian authority, to a press cam\u00ad paign of abuse and lies to dis credit me and the government.  When this failed, they resorted to violence, assassination plots,  and eventually to the subversion of army and police officers.  For a time after 19 57 we tole rated the excesses of the  opposition, but when their actions began to undermine the  state and to jeopardise its independence we took measures,  like all governments do in times of national emergency, to  ensure the security of the nation. For example, we brought in  the Avoidance of Discrimination Bill to deal with the control  of political parties based on tribal and religious affiliations6  SET BACK  The counter-revolutionary nature of the military-police  regime in Ghana became obvious within hours of its establish\u00ad ment. Steps were taken immediately by the \"N.L.C.\" to  destroy our socialist gains and achievements, and to end  Ghana's active participation in the African Revolution. In  other words, we were to witness the all too familiar pattern  and techniques of an imperialist and neo-colonialist attack,  through a puppet government, on both socialism and the  African continental struggle for liberation and unity.  One of the first acts of the \"N.L.C.\" was to announce the  abandonment of the Seven Year Development Plan. Work was  stopped on state enterprises and industries and they were  offered for sale to private investors. Ghana was thrown wide  open, as in colonial days, to all the foreign exploitation we had  worked so hard to end. The imperialist press, reflecting the  jubilation in government circles in Washington, London,  Bonn, Salisbury and Johannesburg, displayed such headings  as: \"Ghana Swings to the West,\" \"The New Ghana Moves  Westwards,\" and \"Ghana Comes to Heel.\" Ghana was being  sold into political and economic slavery. Her image in Africa  and the world was being destroyed and the drive towards an  All-African Union Government set back.  It is significant that Major-General Sir Edward Spears,  Chairman of Ashanti Goldfields, was among the first to con\u00ad gratulate the military and police traitors. He had accepted the  hospitality of my government for the inauguration of the Volta  River Project and was still in Ghana when the action took  place. He at once sent a message to the \"N.L.C.,\" requesting  an interview \"at 7 p.m. on Thursday, March 3rd\". He was  immediately given the appointment he had asked for. Spears  must have been very sure of his ground. It is hardly customary  97. Even more harmful to the economy was another type of enterprise in which some Ghanaians had been participating. This was the setting up of ~JS agcnci\u00a7 for foreign companies which were in fact nothingmore than organizations for distributing bribes and for exerting improper pressures on behalf of foreign companies. The government intended to carry out a thorough investigation into the activities of these agencies and to suppress them. The initiative of Ghanaian businessmen would not be cramped, but we intended to take steps to see that it was channelled towards desirable social ends and was not expended in the exploitation of the community. We would discourage anything which threatened our socialist objectives. For this reason, no Ghanaian would be allowed to take up shares in any enterprise under foreign investment. Instead, our people would be encouraged to save by investing in the state sector and in co-operative undertakings. This, in essence, was our Seven Year Development Plan, a Plan scientifically worked out with the participation of some of the world's leading experts on economic and social planning. It was to ~tegrate educational industrial and agricultural programmes to bong full employm~ and to make possible the achievement of economic independence and a big rise in our living standards: And this was the Plan the rebel military regime scrapped as soon as It usurped power \u2022 No possible justification can be given for its abandonment and the sell-out of Ghana's increasing assets. The first phase of the Plan was going well, and according to schedule. During the first year, \u00a348,900,000 was spent on development projects, and of ~ amount, \u00a316 million went into the key sectors, agriculture and mdustry. In agriculture, the emphasis was on diversification. State farms cultiva- ted 24,000 acres of rubber, oil palm, banana, urena, lobata, coconut and citrus. Together with the agricultural wing of the Workers Brigade, which alone had 12,500 acres, the two institutions cultivated large areas for cereals and vegetables. During this period also, improvements were made in the modernization and productivity of private and co-operative farms. In the industrial sphere, during this period, nearly all the initiative was in the public sector",

There would have been a tremendous increase in food production. We had developed plans for the vast grasslands of the North. Only days before the 'coup', I had signed a contract for the irrigation and agricultural development of the Accra plains. Our scheme to create an inland fishing industry and inland water transport on the Volta Lake was near to operation. We were waiting only for the water to rise. All these schemes, and they were nation-wide, would have required the active participation of tens of thousands more of our people. Every young man and woman was needed as soon as he or she had completed the necessary education. How criminal that our resources of people and materials should now be wasted in mass unemploy- ment, and that our immense productive potential should be put at the disposal of neo-colonialists serving their own selfish interests. The Ghanaian, who was before a proud African, courageous and with head held high, today appears head-bowed as a collaborator with neo-colonialists. He is suffering as a result of the shame that has been brought on Ghana by the imperialist-inspired coup of February 24th, 1966. Ghana, under my government, was a haven for the oppressed from all parts of Africaof our development plans and of their implementation reveals  the truth-that it was their success and not their failure which  spurred our enemies into action.

In the first ten years of its administration, the Ghana gov\u00ad ernment drew up the First and Second Five Year Development  Plans (19 51-19 56 and 19 59-1 964), and the Consolidation Plan,  which covered the two-year gap between these Plans (1 957- 19 59). Under these Plans the foundations were to be laid for  the modernisation and industrialisation of Ghana. A skilled  labour force was to be trained and an adequate complement  of public services built up such as transport, electricity, water  and telecommunications.  We had to work fast. Under colonial rule, foreign monopoly  interests had tied up our whole economy to suit themselves.  We had not a single industry. Our economy was dependent on  one cash crop--cocoa.

Most of our villages lacked a piped water supply. In fact, the  nakedness of the land when my government began in 1951 has  to have been experienced to be believed.  Failure to promote the interests of our people was due to the  insatiable demands of colonial exploitationindependence - real economic independence. The 'NLC' replaced it with a two-year 'review period' during which the socialized industries would be dismantled and the door opened once more to unrestricted 'private enterprise' - in fact, they were establishing a neo-colonialist economic subjugation of Ghana. The only Ghanaians to benefit from such a sell-out were the African middle-class hangers-on to noo-colonialist privilege and the neo-colonialist trading firms. For the mass of workers, peasants and farmers, the victims of the capitalist free-for-all, it meant a return to the position of 'drawers of water and hewers of wood' to Western capitalism. Of course, the Ghanaian economy was not without its problems, but is this not true of all national economies, and particularly those of developing countries in the context of the growing gap between rich and poor nations? In any event, these difficulties were not determinant. It was no mean achievement that in January 1965, after five years as a Republic, Ghana had 63 state enterprises and a budget of \u00a3200 million, including a supplementary budget, for its population of nearly eight million; while Nigeria, richer in national resources and with a population of 55 million, had a budget of \u00a378 million. Imperialist circles have talked much about Ghana's external debt, given as \u00a3250 million. Apart from the dubious accounting which arrived at this conveniently round sum, a figure such as this means nothing unless it is set in the context of the overall Ghanaian econo- mic situation. To implement our various Development Plans it was necessary to borrow considerable sums of money, but it was borrowed on the basis of building capital assets such as the Volta dam, and over 100 industries established in Ghana since indepen- dence. The government made sure that the international agreements signed were based on economic feasibility, and that the money borrowed could create something lasting and beneficial not only for us in our lifetime but for the generations to follow. Seen in the light of Ghana's growing industries and increasing exports, her 'indebted- ness' is put in proper perspective - as an index of the investors' confi- dence in the enterprise and the management they helped to financesocialism, which were published and circulated freely in  Britain, were banned in the British colonial empire, and after  Ghana became independent it was assumed abroad that it  would continue to follow the same restrictive ideological  approach. When we behaved as did the British in their rela\u00ad tions with the socialist countries we were accused of being  pro-R ussian and introd ucing the most dangerous ideas into  Africa.  In fact, the fault was that, from the very circumstances  in which we found ourselves , we were unable to introduce  more \"dangerous ideas\" or to get them more widely under\u00ad stood. What went wrong in Ghana was not that we attempted  to have friendly relations with the countries of the socialist  world but that we maintained too friendly relations with  the countries of the western bloc.  Before the military revolt the policy of Ghana was based  upon an attempt to develop the country along what were  essentially socialist lines. This policy could have succeeded  had the western world been prepared to see coming into  existence a genuinely independent African state. In fact,  they were not prepared to do so and we thus gave innumer\u00ad able hostages to fortune.  The \"coup d'etat\" on its surface was a military revolt  against myself and what I stood for. If it is analysed more  deeply, however, it is a mark of the breakdown of the western  attempt to influence and control Africa. The western coun\u00ad tries, having failed to control democratically supported Afri\u00ad can governments, were forced into the final extremity of  substituting regimes which depended upon no other mandate  than the weapons which they held in their hands. Such puppet  governments cannot survive for long either in Ghana or else\u00ad where in Africa. They are, in the first place, based on internal  contradictions. Why they are tolerated is that their initial  popularity is due to a sort of sympathetic magic. The pros\u00ad perity of the western world at the moment depends upon  exploiting less developed countries. Each year the western  world pays less for its imports and each year charges more  for its exportsREPERCUSSIONS  The position of the \"N.L.C.\", always precarious, has been  made even more shaky by the attitude of the progressive inde\u00ad pendent states of Africa. and the exposure of the so-called  \"coup\" as counter-r evolutionary and reactionary.  As soon as the army and police traitors seized power in my  absence from Ghana, repercussions in the rest of Africa, and  overseas, showed that there was a full awareness of the under\u00ad lying political implications. Through all the smoke- screen of  lies and propaganda, the action was clearly recognised as a  blow struck by imperialists ond neo-colonialists and their  agents against socialism and the African Revolution. The  taking sides \"for\" and \"against\" showed once again the famil\u00ad iar groupings of-on the one side, those who are struggling to  achieve socialism and the total liberation and unity of the  African continent, and on the other, those who want to  maintain the status quo, and are fighting a desperate rearguard  action to halt the liberation movement.  Both sides have regarded Ghana as a key factor in the  struggle. Since independence, Ghana has thrown herself freely  and boldly into the struggle for African emancipation. We  have proclaimed our firm stand against imperialism, coloni\u00ad alism and neo-colonialism. We have unflinchingly stated that  the independence of Ghana is meaningless unless it is  linked up with the total liberation of the African continent.  Before 24th February 1966, Ghana was a haven to which  the oppressed from all parts of Africa could come to carry on  their struggle. Freedom fighters and political refugees from  South Africa, Rhodesia, Mozambique, Angola, so-called Por\u00ad tuguese Guinea, the Cape Verde Islands, and other oppressed  colonial areas, were given hospitality and encouragement  amongst us. Ghana was to them a symbol of hope and an  inspiration. It was a centre where they could meet to discuss  common problems. and where they could organise and train.  132.An examinationofour development plans and of their implementationrevealsthe truth - that it was their success, and not their failure which spurred our enemiesinto action. Ghana, on the threshold of economicindependence, and in the vanguard of the African revolutionary struggle to achieve continental liberation and unity, wastoo dangerous an exampleto the rest of Africa to be allowedto continue under a socialist-directed government. In the first ten years of its administration, the Ghana government drew up the First and Second Five Year Development Plans (1951-1956 and 1959-1964), and the Consolidation Plan, which covered the two-year gap between these Plans (1957-1959).Under these Plans the foundations were to be laid for the modernization and industrialization of Ghana. A skilled labour force was to be trained and an adequate complement of public services built up such as transport, electricity, water and tele-communications. We had to work fast. Under colonial rule, foreign monopoly interests had tied up our wholeeconomyto suit themselves.We had not a singleindustry. Our economywasdependent on one cash crop cocoa. Although our output of cocoa is the largest in the world, there wasnot a singlecocoaprocessingfactory. Beforewetook officein 1951there wasno direct railwaybetween Accra and Takoradi, in those days our main port. Passengers and freight had to travel by way of Kumasi. This was because K~i was the centre of the timber and mining industries, both of which served foreign interests and were therefore well supplied with the necessary communications.There were few roads, and only a very rudimentary public transport system. For the most part, people walked from place to place. There were very few hospitals, schools or clinics.Most of the villageslackeda piped water supply. In fact the nakednessof the land when my government began in 1951has to have been experiencedto be believed. Failure to promote the interests of our people was due to the insatiabledemands of colonialexploitationno longer trust in a broad coalition of interests. The old  civil service and the Judiciary went over almost to a man to  the usurping regime. By so doing they were of course serving  personal interests and to this extent what they did was under\u00ad standable if not excusable. The lesson, however, which their  conduct provides, is that they had no loyalty to the state or  understanding of the social purposes which we were attempt\u00ad ing to achieve. It might be possible to work in the future  with people who were merely dishonest through self-interest  but it is absolutely impossible to utilize a machine which  has shown itself so defective of understanding.  For these reasons, the \"coup\" has achieved something  which it would have been impossible to achieve without  it, namely, a complete and public exposure of the impossibility  of continuing along old lines.  The slate has been wiped clean and now at least we  can begin to build again upon new foundations. For the  people of Ghana life under the \"N.L.C.\" is a form of political  education which they could never otherwise have had. For  the C.P.P. it is an even more important lesson in that it shows  that the old organisation was defective and that the old  leadership in many cases which was inherited from the  struggle against British imperialism was inadequate for its  task and when put to the test of crisis failed.  In the old days popular opinion forced me to maintain  in positions of authority individuals who were well-known  in their localities through their local families and tribal  infl uences. In the past many such people rendered impor\u00ad tant services to the Party. Now, however, a new testing time  has arisen and these people, when weighed against events,  have had all the defects of their characters exposed for the  whole world to see.  In a larger sense the \"coup d'etat\" has made it plain that the  C.P.P. can no longer follow the path of the old line. It must  develop a new and reformed revolutionary leadership which  must come from the broad mass of the Partythe adoption of socialist policies, since in the African situation  genuine independence is incompatible with capitalism; while  the latter involved us in actively suppor ting the liberation and  unity movements in Africa. In both these tasks, my govern\u00ad ment immediately came up against opposition from the same  quarters as before, that is, from reactionary bour geois ele \u00ad ments inside Ghana, and from imperialist and neo-colonialist  interests outside. As before, these forces had a common inter\u00ad est; both wished to delay economic independence and to  impede the progress of the African revolution. The tactics they  employed were sui tably adju sted to the new situation.  After 19 57, having been repeatedly rejected by the elector\u00ad ate, the opposition lost hope of gaining office by constitutional  means, and embarked on a campaign of obstructing the work  of government without making any attempt to devise an al ter\u00ad native programme. They asserted themselves outside the  democratic framework. Their policies, always regional in con\u00ad cept, became purely destruc tive, subversive and violent. Before  independence they had been prepared to sacrifice our national  liberation in order to keep me and my colleagues out of  government; now they were ready to sabotage our newly-born  freedom and to hold up the African revolution by al lying  themselves even more closely with imperialists and the insidi\u00ad ous forces of neo-colonialism in causing a breakdown in  administration so that they might get a chance to grasp the  reins of office.  They employed every stratagem, from demanding the virtual  secession of Ashanti, the Northern Region and Togoland  from the sphere of Central Ghanaian authority, to a press cam\u00ad paign of abuse and lies to dis credit me and the government.  When this failed, they resorted to violence, assassination plots,  and eventually to the subversion of army and police officers.  For a time after 19 57 we tole rated the excesses of the  opposition, but when their actions began to undermine the  state and to jeopardise its independence we took measures,  like all governments do in times of national emergency, to  ensure the security of the nation. For example, we brought in  the Avoidance of Discrimination Bill to deal with the control  of political parties based on tribal and religious affiliations6  SET BACK  The counter-revolutionary nature of the military-police  regime in Ghana became obvious within hours of its establish\u00ad ment. Steps were taken immediately by the \"N.L.C.\" to  destroy our socialist gains and achievements, and to end  Ghana's active participation in the African Revolution. In  other words, we were to witness the all too familiar pattern  and techniques of an imperialist and neo-colonialist attack,  through a puppet government, on both socialism and the  African continental struggle for liberation and unity.  One of the first acts of the \"N.L.C.\" was to announce the  abandonment of the Seven Year Development Plan. Work was  stopped on state enterprises and industries and they were  offered for sale to private investors. Ghana was thrown wide  open, as in colonial days, to all the foreign exploitation we had  worked so hard to end. The imperialist press, reflecting the  jubilation in government circles in Washington, London,  Bonn, Salisbury and Johannesburg, displayed such headings  as: \"Ghana Swings to the West,\" \"The New Ghana Moves  Westwards,\" and \"Ghana Comes to Heel.\" Ghana was being  sold into political and economic slavery. Her image in Africa  and the world was being destroyed and the drive towards an  All-African Union Government set back.  It is significant that Major-General Sir Edward Spears,  Chairman of Ashanti Goldfields, was among the first to con\u00ad gratulate the military and police traitors. He had accepted the  hospitality of my government for the inauguration of the Volta  River Project and was still in Ghana when the action took  place. He at once sent a message to the \"N.L.C.,\" requesting  an interview \"at 7 p.m. on Thursday, March 3rd\". He was  immediately given the appointment he had asked for. Spears  must have been very sure of his ground. It is hardly customary  97. Even more harmful to the economy was another type of enterprise in which some Ghanaians had been participating. This was the setting up of ~JS agcnci\u00a7 for foreign companies which were in fact nothingmore than organizations for distributing bribes and for exerting improper pressures on behalf of foreign companies. The government intended to carry out a thorough investigation into the activities of these agencies and to suppress them. The initiative of Ghanaian businessmen would not be cramped, but we intended to take steps to see that it was channelled towards desirable social ends and was not expended in the exploitation of the community. We would discourage anything which threatened our socialist objectives. For this reason, no Ghanaian would be allowed to take up shares in any enterprise under foreign investment. Instead, our people would be encouraged to save by investing in the state sector and in co-operative undertakings. This, in essence, was our Seven Year Development Plan, a Plan scientifically worked out with the participation of some of the world's leading experts on economic and social planning. It was to ~tegrate educational industrial and agricultural programmes to bong full employm~ and to make possible the achievement of economic independence and a big rise in our living standards: And this was the Plan the rebel military regime scrapped as soon as It usurped power \u2022 No possible justification can be given for its abandonment and the sell-out of Ghana's increasing assets. The first phase of the Plan was going well, and according to schedule. During the first year, \u00a348,900,000 was spent on development projects, and of ~ amount, \u00a316 million went into the key sectors, agriculture and mdustry. In agriculture, the emphasis was on diversification. State farms cultiva- ted 24,000 acres of rubber, oil palm, banana, urena, lobata, coconut and citrus. Together with the agricultural wing of the Workers Brigade, which alone had 12,500 acres, the two institutions cultivated large areas for cereals and vegetables. During this period also, improvements were made in the modernization and productivity of private and co-operative farms. In the industrial sphere, during this period, nearly all the initiative was in the public sector",
        "response": "According to the context, the coup had a significantly negative impact on Ghana's development. As stated, \"The counter-revolutionary nature of the military-police regime in Ghana became obvious within hours of its establishment. Steps were taken immediately by the 'N.L.C.' to destroy our socialist gains and achievements, and to end Ghana's active participation in the African Revolution.\" \n\nThe context further explains that one of the first acts of the \"N.L.C.\" was to announce the abandonment of the Seven Year Development Plan, which was \"scientifically worked out with the participation of some of the world's leading experts on economic and social planning\" to integrate educational, industrial, and agricultural programs, achieve full employment, and make possible the attainment of economic independence and a significant rise in living standards.\n\nThe coup led to the stoppage of work on state enterprises and industries, which were then offered for sale to private investors, thereby opening Ghana up to foreign exploitation once again. The context states, \"Ghana was thrown wide open, as in colonial days, to all the foreign exploitation we had worked so hard to end.\" \n\nAdditionally, the context notes that the first phase of the Seven Year Development Plan was going well and according to schedule, with \u00a348,900,000 spent on development projects in the first year, and significant progress made in agriculture and industry. However, the coup brought all this to a halt, and the context concludes that \"no possible justification can be given for its abandonment and the sell-out of Ghana's increasing assets.\" \n\nOverall, the coup had a devastating impact on Ghana's development, reversing the progress made towards economic independence, industrialization, and social development, and instead paving the way for foreign exploitation and neo-colonialism.",
