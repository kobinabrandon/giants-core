        "question": "How was Nkumah able to campaign for independence?",
        "context": "The amendment was defeated by a majority of 37. Where \u00ad upon, adopting their old tactics, the opposition issued a state\u00ad ment to the press saying they would absent themselves from  the Assembly when the Independence Motion came before the  Ho use. Busia, showing where his real support lay, announced  that he consid ered the struggle centred not in the Gold Coast  but in London, and that the opposition would send a delega\u00ad tion to the British government.  As I recall these times, when the opposition persistently  refused either to participate in national discussions or to  respect the decision of the great majority of the people, I  wonder how they managed to retain even the little support  they had. Their actions were so unpatriotic, dishonest and un\u00ad di gnified . They aligned themselves with those who wished to  retard the country's progress towards independence. At the  same time, while loudly proclaiming their belief in democracy,  they were prepared to try to force the will of a small minority  on the majority of the nation, and so make a farce of parlia\u00ad mentary government.  Busia who led the opposition delegation to London, actually  appealed to the British government not to grant independence.  He said the country was not ready for it : \"We still need you  (the British) in the Gold Coast.\" I imagine he would say today  that the Americans were needed ! He found some support  among sections of the British press, but there could be no  denying that the conditions laid down by the Secretary of  State, that my motion for independence should be passed by  \"a reasonable majority in the newly elected Legislature\", had  been satisfied, and at long last a date for independence was  fixed-the 6th of March 19 57.  The long struggle to achieve our political freedom was over.  But in a sense our task of building a really independent  Ghana was only just beginning. Political independence was  incomplete without economic independence, and as I said in  the midni ght pronoun cement of independence in Accra on 6th  March 19 57, \"the independence of Ghana is meaningless  unless it is linked up with the total liberation of the African  continent\".  My government, therefore, was pledged to the twin task  of achieving economic independence for Ghanaindependence but evolved a work and happiness programme of reconstruction. We also joined in the great movement for the liberation and political unification of Africa. The achievement of the Convention People's Party under my leadership is an open book. It can be seen by all, and today, anyone who visits Ghana can be a witness of this great achievement. Inter- nationally, independent Ghana has been playing her role in world affairs. She has supported peace and will always continue to support any movement that can lead to the peace and security of the world. In all this struggle, the Convention People's Party, and its Govern- ment have not shed a single drop of a Ghanaian's blood. I shuddered when I learned of the shooting and killing of defenceless men and women, and the arrest, intimidation and imprisonment of many of the leading patriots of the country. The blood of these gallant men and women cry to heaven for redress. Their blood shall not be shed in vain. Those who have died, may they rest in peace. By the arrest, detention and assassination of Ministers, the party's civil servants, trade unionists and by the blind massacre of defenceless men and women, the authors of these insane acts of robbery, violence, intimidation and assassination have added brutality to their treason. Never before in the cherished history of our new Ghana have citizens, men and women, been assassinated in cold blood and never have their children become orphans for political reasons. Never before have Ghanaians been shot down because of their political convictions. This is a tragedy of monstrous proportions. But I know your courage and determination: I see the extent of your indignation against this wanton rebellion. I know that at the appropriate time you will take the initiative to crush it. The Party's dynamism will rise up again to save your dignity and personality. As far as I am concerned I will do my very best to crush this criminal rebellionvotes to none, Dr Busia, officialleader of the Opposition, actually travelled to London to appeal to the British government not to grant Independence. But on 17th September I was informed by the Governor that the British government had at last, in response to our formal request for a firm date for Independence, fixed on the 6th of March, 1957. At midnight on 5/6th March, 1957, a crowd estimated at 100,000 assembled on the Polo Ground in Accra to hear the official pronouncement of Independence. The Union Jack was lowered, and the red, green and gold flag of Ghana raised in its place to the cries of FREEDOM, FREEDOM, FREEDOM. By employing the oppressor's own methods of parlia- mentary procedure, and through the tactics of Positive Action, we had been able to exert sufficientpressure on the colonial power to force a negotiated independence. The political, or nationalist revolution had beeJ;lwon, and without the necessity to resort to armed struggle. But the struggle for true freedom in the wider context of the African Revolution and the world socialist revolution was only just beginning. In order to liberate and unify Mrica under an All-Mrican Union Government, and to defeat the forces of imperialism and neocolonialism, and construct socialism, it would be necessary in future to employ all forms of political action, including armed struggle. EXTRACT FROM THE MIDNIGHT PRONOUNCEMENT OF INDEPENDENCE Sth-6th March, 1957 At long last the battle has ended. And thus Ghana, your beloved country isfree for ever.And here again,I wantto takethe opportunity 120 to thank the chiefs and people of this country, the youth, the farmers, the women, who have so nobly fought and won this battle. Also I want to thank the valiant ex-servicemen who have so co- operated with me in this mighty task of freeing our country from foreign rule and imperialism. And as I pointed out at our Party conference at Saltpond, I made it quite clear that from now on, today, we must change our attitudes and our minds. We must realize that from now on we are no more a colonialbut a free and independent peopleof the fact that your whole life was dedicated to the  total liberation, the total survival of all mankind, and  particularly, for the progress and well-being of the  African continent and its peoples-the solution, so far  as the colonialists are concerned, was only to find ways  and means of subversion, to put a yes-man traitor in  your place as Head of State.  The question which every nationalist asks him /her\u00ad self is : \"Is it the end of the African Revolution, or is  it just a beginning?\" During the last fifteen years,  Africa has lost more outstanding leaders and statesmen  than Europe and Asia put together. Patrice Lumumba  was murdered; Ahmed Ben Bella ousted, and no one  knows of his whereabouts, except those concerned;  Joshua Nkomo is in the hands of those diabolical white  settlers in Rhodesia; and last but most important of all,  the great African leader, President K wame Nkrumah  is missing (though only for a temporary period of time).  So far, the colon ialists have succeeded in playing  with Africa, and the cold war has been shifted to all  corners of this continent, which used to be the most  peaceful place for man to live in-without disturbance  and want. Heavy wounds are inflicted on us, and it  seems our recovery is doubted .... I vowed to follow  to the end any genuine African leader who dedicates  his life for the common good, common welfare, com\u00ad mon progress, and the total liberation of Africa as a  whole. I am very sure of your greatness, President  Nkrumah, and I am ready to die for you because I feel  that my life is nothing to be compared with yours. You  have saved millions of lives, and the peoples of all  countries recognise your achievements.  Since that shameful time of February 1966, I and  friends of mine in the Somali Republic have been  actively collecting information from the Somali masses,  and we have been fully assured by thousands that they  are ready to serve the great African leader, President  K wame Nkrumah, even at the cost of their lives. I  sincerely hope that the President will give us the oppor\u00ad tunity to fight for our good future and for the future  of all the peoples of our continent.  153. The CPP victory in the 1954 election had given us a clear mandate to negotiate 'self government now', and . there was no justification for calling another general election before Independence. But the British govern- ment insisted that a general election must be held, and a Motion calling for Independence be passed by 'a reason- able majority' in the newly-elected Legislature, before a firm date could be agreed for Independence. In May 1956I presented to the Assembly the Govem- ment's White Paper containing the constitutional pro- posals for a sovereign and independent Gold Coast, to be known in future as Ghana. The Motion was debated and passed on the 5th of June, whereupon the Governor dissolved the National Assembly and declared that a general election would take place in July. In the introduction to the CPP election manifesto I said that there were only two questions which the elector need consider: 'Do I want independence in my life time? or 'Do I want to revert to feudalism and imperialism?' The red-herring of federalism co~d not be allowed to confuse the issue. . As a result of the election, the CPP won 71 seats, increased later by the support of one of the Independents, to give a CPP majority of 40 in the Assembly of 104 members, a 'reasonable majority' acceptable to the British government, specially since our support came from every region of the country. Even in Ashanti, where the NLM boasted strong support, the CPP gained 43 per cent of the total votes cast. The NLM leadership, however, refused to accept the verdict of the people, declared once more in favour of a federal form of government, and announced that Opposition members would not attend the Assembly when the Independence Motion camebefore the House. After the Independence Motion was passed, by 72 119",
        "response": "According to the context, Nkrumah was able to campaign for independence by employing \"the oppressor's own methods of parliamentary procedure, and through the tactics of Positive Action\". This allowed him to exert sufficient pressure on the colonial power to force a negotiated independence. Additionally, as stated in the context, \"the CPP victory in the 1954 election had given us a clear mandate to negotiate 'self government now'\". Nkrumah also presented a White Paper containing constitutional proposals for a sovereign and independent Gold Coast, and the CPP won a majority of 40 in the Assembly of 104 members, which was acceptable to the British government. \n\nAs mentioned, \"the introduction to the CPP election manifesto\" highlighted that the main question was whether the people wanted independence in their lifetime or wanted to revert to feudalism and imperialism. This approach helped to galvanize support for the independence movement. Furthermore, Nkrumah's message of independence and his leadership of the Convention People's Party (CPP) helped to mobilize the people, including \"the chiefs and people of this country, the youth, the farmers, the women\", and \"the valiant ex-servicemen\" who \"so nobly fought and won this battle\" for independence.",

After the Independence Motion was passed, by 72 119Assemblies, Ashanti was omitted and special regulations were  introduced giving it powers superior to those of the other Regions.  Everywhere else the head of the Region was to be chosen by the  House of Chiefs. In Ashanti, the constitution specifically stated  that \u2018the Asantehene shall be the Head of the Ashanti Region\u2019.  What kind of democracy were the British laying down on the eve  of their departure, in designating the person who was to be the  effective governor of a particular Region? Where was the  respect for our sovereignty ? Our independence was supposed to  give us sovereignty over our own affairs. But there we were, a  democratic Government, limited by constitutional provisions,  designed by the retiring power, to a designated individual to  conduct the highest executive post in the most delicate national  territory. It was so openly a device to concede to the opposition  party the opportunities they had been deprived of by their  defeat at the polls that it was difficult to believe the British  could have been so deceitful to their much-vaunted respect for  democracy. The choice of the Asantehene for this special elevation was  deliberate. He was known to share the views of the National  Liberation Movement, whose politics of violence had made our  final steps to independence so immensely difficult. Considerable  suspicion as to his original connections with the Movement had  been current since its inception, because his chief linguist, the  man closest to him in the affairs of the Ashanti state, was a  founder member and its Chairman. The Asantehene had  worked well with the British, even though his uncle Prempeh I  had fought them in the Ashanti wars earlier in the century and  had been exiled to the Seychelles islands for his African  patriotism. For his services to the British in carrying out their  colonial rule, the Asantehene had been knighted. His position as  the spiritual and temporal head of Ashanti gave him the in\u00ad fluence of a feudal lord over all the chiefs of the Region and over  the local people, and made him extremely powerful. By seeking  to safeguard his continued authority in the new Ghana through  specific clauses in the constitution, the British were not only  repaying him for services rendered and making good in part the  promise of the N.L.MINTRODUCTION xi battled our way to independence shall not stand quiet until the  last stronghold of colonialism has been laid to the ground in  Africa. For we have dedicated ourselves to the attainment of total  African freedom. Here is one bond of unity that allies free Africa  with unfree Africa, as well as all those independent states  dedicated to this cause. My party, the Convention People\u2019s  Party, fervently upholds, as an unquestionable right, the burning  aspirations of the still subjected peoples of our continent for  freedom. Since our inception, we have raised as a cardinal  policy, the total emancipation of Africa from colonialism in all  its forms. To this we have added the objective of the political  union of African states as the securest safeguard of our hard-won  freedom and the soundest foundation for our individual, no less  than our common, economic, social and cultural advancement. In my Autobiography, and to some extent also in another book  of mine, I Speak of Freedom , I tried to show how, and why, the  struggle for independence developed and succeeded in the then  Gold Coast. My purpose now is to trace briefly the African  background and the effects of centuries of colonialism on the  political, economic and social life of Africa as a whole; to place  developments in Ghana in the broader context of the African  revolution; and to explain my political philosophy based on my  conviction of the need for the freedom and unification of Africa  and its islands.1 1 The following are the islands of Africa: (i) Canary Islands Gran Canaria,  Tenerife, Las Palmas, Ferro, Fuerte-Ventura, Lanzarote, Spanish; (2) Cape  Verde Islands (Sto. Antao, Sao Tiago), Portuguese; (3) Madeira with  Selvagens, Portuguese; (4) Arquipelago dos Bijagos (Caravela, Roxa),  Portuguese', (5) Los Island, Guinea; (6) Fernando Po, Spanish; (7) Principe,  Portuguese; (8) Sao Tome, Portuguese; (9) Annohon,Spanish;  (10) Ascension,  British; (11) StOn the morning of the 12th of February, 1951, after having served fourteen months of my three year sentence, I was released from prison and driven through immense, cheering crowds first to the Arena for an expiation ceremony, and then to Party headquarters. The next day the Governor invited me to form a government, for the CPP had won 34 out of a possible 38 elected seats in the municipal and rural areas, and the Party had also a majority in the Assembly over the nominated candidates. A meeting of the Central Committee was convened, and a Government wasformed. Asleader of the majority Party in the Assembly, I became Leader of Government Business. It wasgoing to be difficultto work under the conditions of the Coussey Constitution, but I at once made it clear that we intended to go ahead with our campaign for full self govemment. Our sweeping victory at the polls was our mandate; and nothing would stand in our way. We did not rule out the possibility of further Positive Action if colonial officialdom obstructed our purpose. 'The die is cast', I said in an Address to CPP members of the Assembly, 'the exploited and oppressed people of colonial Africa and elsewhere are looking up to us for hope and inspiration. Progressive people in Britain and elsewhere are also solidly behind us. The torch of the Liberation Movement has been lifted up in Ghana for the whole of West Mrica, and it will blaze a trail of freedom for other oppressed territories.' The decision to continue the struggle for national liberation by constitutional means was taken simply because it was considered to be the method most likely to succeed in the circumstances of the time. For the sole criterion in deciding upon what form a revolutionary struggle should take at a particular time is the revol- utionary objective, and how best to achieve it. If the CPP had contracted out of the procedure of parliamentary government which the colonialpower had foisted upon us, 98 the progress towards national liberation could not have gone ahead at that time, and the political revolution would have been immeasurably delayed8 The CPP government was prepared to recognize the NPP as an unofficialOpposition, but within a few months the NPP and the remnants of various other Parties which had at one time or another opposed the CPP, merged to form the National Liberation Movement (NLM). The NLM at once began to campaign for a federal form of government. The Asanteman Council, headed by the Asantehene, joined forces with the NLM, and drew support from certain sections of the Ashanti people opposed to the Cocoa Duty and Development Funds (Amendment) Billwhich was passed in August 1954.This Bill fixed and guaranteed the price paid to cocoa farmers, and provided for the use of the funds from cocoa sales to expand the economy of the country as a whole. In general, the cocoa farmers welcomed the Bill, but anti- CPP elements made use of it to attack the government by stirring up regional animosities. In particular, it was alleged that the government was spending too much on developing the coastal or Colony region, and neglecting Ashanti, the main cocoa-producing region. Outbreaks of violence occured in Ashanti. Hundreds of Ashanti CPP members were compelled to leav~ the region, and certain CPP chiefs were destooled. It was during this period of unrest that an attempt was made to assassinate me. A bomb exploded at my house in Accra, shaking it severely and shattering all the windows. I was at home at the time, and although the house was filled with people fortunately no-one was injured. Meantime, the Opposition continued to agitate for another election, basing their campaign on the federation issue. Three times the NLM turned down invitations to discuss the matter, and NLM members walked out of the Assembly every time constitutional issues were raised. I therefore introduced a Motion in the Assembly on 5th April, 1955 for the setting up of a Select Committee to examine the question of a federal system of government. u7 Before the general election of 1st June 1954 took place, electoral and representational reforms were made to increase the membership of the Legislative Assembly and to make it more representativethe adoption of socialist policies, since in the African situation  genuine independence is incompatible with capitalism; while  the latter involved us in actively suppor ting the liberation and  unity movements in Africa. In both these tasks, my govern\u00ad ment immediately came up against opposition from the same  quarters as before, that is, from reactionary bour geois ele \u00ad ments inside Ghana, and from imperialist and neo-colonialist  interests outside. As before, these forces had a common inter\u00ad est; both wished to delay economic independence and to  impede the progress of the African revolution. The tactics they  employed were sui tably adju sted to the new situation.  After 19 57, having been repeatedly rejected by the elector\u00ad ate, the opposition lost hope of gaining office by constitutional  means, and embarked on a campaign of obstructing the work  of government without making any attempt to devise an al ter\u00ad native programme. They asserted themselves outside the  democratic framework. Their policies, always regional in con\u00ad cept, became purely destruc tive, subversive and violent. Before  independence they had been prepared to sacrifice our national  liberation in order to keep me and my colleagues out of  government; now they were ready to sabotage our newly-born  freedom and to hold up the African revolution by al lying  themselves even more closely with imperialists and the insidi\u00ad ous forces of neo-colonialism in causing a breakdown in  administration so that they might get a chance to grasp the  reins of office.  They employed every stratagem, from demanding the virtual  secession of Ashanti, the Northern Region and Togoland  from the sphere of Central Ghanaian authority, to a press cam\u00ad paign of abuse and lies to dis credit me and the government.  When this failed, they resorted to violence, assassination plots,  and eventually to the subversion of army and police officers.  For a time after 19 57 we tole rated the excesses of the  opposition, but when their actions began to undermine the  state and to jeopardise its independence we took measures,  like all governments do in times of national emergency, to  ensure the security of the nation. For example, we brought in  the Avoidance of Discrimination Bill to deal with the control  of political parties based on tribal and religious affiliations",
        "response": "According to the context, Nkrumah was able to campaign for independence by employing the oppressor's own methods of parliamentary procedure, and through the tactics of Positive Action. As he stated, \"the die is cast\", and he made it clear that his party, the Convention People's Party (CPP), intended to go ahead with their campaign for full self-government. He also said, \"the torch of the Liberation Movement has been lifted up in Ghana for the whole of West Africa, and it will blaze a trail of freedom for other oppressed territories.\" \n\nAdditionally, Nkrumah's party won several elections, including the 1954 election, which gave them a clear mandate to negotiate 'self-government now'. He also presented a White Paper containing constitutional proposals for a sovereign and independent Gold Coast, to be known in future as Ghana, and the Motion was debated and passed on the 5th of June. \n\nNkrumah's strategy was to use the existing parliamentary system to push for independence, while also mobilizing the people through Positive Action, which was a tactic used by the CPP to put pressure on the colonial power to grant independence. As he mentioned, \"the decision to continue the struggle for national liberation by constitutional means was taken simply because it was considered to be the method most likely to succeed in the circumstances of the time.\"",
