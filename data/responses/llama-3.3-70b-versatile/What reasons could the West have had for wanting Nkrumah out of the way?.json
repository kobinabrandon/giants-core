        "context": "Ghana. that if I knew of the potential disloyalty in the army  why did I not deal with it? The very posing of this question  discloses the fundamental misunder standing about the  Ghanaian position as it existed before the 'coup' in many  friendly circles abroad.  As I then saw it, my task was two-fold. On the one hand,  I had to secure a firm basis in Ghana and on the other,  conduct an external policy which would lead to the liberation  and unity of the whole African continent, and to the economic  co-operation which was essential if any territory in Africa was  to escape from neo- colonialism. In the military sense these  two aims were contradictory.  I could, for example, have avoided any risk of a military  revolt by maintaining the system which the British Govern\u00ad ment assumed would be maintained after independence, by  which Britain would continue to supply for 10 to 15 years  our key military personnel. The individual loyalties of such  officers and their training, combined with the political com\u00ad plications for Britain which would have resulted in their  joining in a revolt, would have made it unlikely that a military  take-over could take place. On the other hand, if I maintained  a non-African officered army, Ghana could not play a sig\u00ad nificant military part in the affairs of the continent.  Yet the tragedy of the Congo made one thing absolutely  clear, that even small African forces on the spot at the right  time could control the situation and prevent a neo-colonialist  take-over. I therefore was not in a position to abolish the  Ghanaian army, though this would have been an ideal course.  It was a heavy charge on our limited resources for industrial  development. On the other hand, looking at the problem from  a continental point of view, if Ghana had no armed forces  at all it must lose much of its influence with other African  states. I have always said that for me the issue of African  unity came before any other consideration. It was for this  reason that I was prepared to run the risk of maintaining  for the time being a traditional British-type army.  A Ghanaian army with British officers could have no  influence in Africadestroy the political, economic and social achievements  of the last few years, but will also obstruct the course  of the African revolution.  All that has been achieved by the Ghanaian people  with the assistance of all our friends is in jeopardy.  I am returning to Ghana; I know that the friendly  nations and people of good will everywhere will support  me in restoring the constitutional government of  Ghana.  I take this opportun ity to express my smcere condo\u00ad lences to all the families whose valiant sons and  daughters have given their lives in the defence of  Ghana.  At this moment, as I leave Peking, the capital city  of the People's Republic of China, I express my pro\u00ad found gratitude to the Chinese people and to their  leaders for their support and their kind hospitality.  We landed near Moscow at dawn on 1s t March, after a brief  stop at Irkutsk in Siberia, and were met by leading Soviet  gPvernment officials. After a busy day of talks I re-embarked  at midni ght for the flight to Guinea.  We touched down briefly in Yugoslavia, and in Algeria,  and reached Conakry in the afternoon of Wednesday, 2nd  March. It was wonderful to be on African soil again. Guinea  was agog with excitement. President Sekou Toure and mem \u00ad bers of the Political Bureau of the Democratic Party were  among the huge crowd at the airport to welcome me. A twenty\u00ad one gun salute was fired.  At a mass rally in the packed sports stadium in Conakry the  foll owing day, President Sekou Toure anno unced that I had  been made Secretarv-General of the Guinean Democratic  Party and Head of State of Guinea. \"The Ghanaian traitors,\"  he said \"have been mistaken in thinking that Nkrumah is  simply a Ghanaian . ... He is a universal man.\" It looked as  though the entire population of Conakry was in the stadium  that afternoon and I shall never furget the reception they gave  to Sekou Toure and myself as we were driven round the arena  in an open carsocialism, which were published and circulated freely in  Britain, were banned in the British colonial empire, and after  Ghana became independent it was assumed abroad that it  would continue to follow the same restrictive ideological  approach. When we behaved as did the British in their rela\u00ad tions with the socialist countries we were accused of being  pro-R ussian and introd ucing the most dangerous ideas into  Africa.  In fact, the fault was that, from the very circumstances  in which we found ourselves , we were unable to introduce  more \"dangerous ideas\" or to get them more widely under\u00ad stood. What went wrong in Ghana was not that we attempted  to have friendly relations with the countries of the socialist  world but that we maintained too friendly relations with  the countries of the western bloc.  Before the military revolt the policy of Ghana was based  upon an attempt to develop the country along what were  essentially socialist lines. This policy could have succeeded  had the western world been prepared to see coming into  existence a genuinely independent African state. In fact,  they were not prepared to do so and we thus gave innumer\u00ad able hostages to fortune.  The \"coup d'etat\" on its surface was a military revolt  against myself and what I stood for. If it is analysed more  deeply, however, it is a mark of the breakdown of the western  attempt to influence and control Africa. The western coun\u00ad tries, having failed to control democratically supported Afri\u00ad can governments, were forced into the final extremity of  substituting regimes which depended upon no other mandate  than the weapons which they held in their hands. Such puppet  governments cannot survive for long either in Ghana or else\u00ad where in Africa. They are, in the first place, based on internal  contradictions. Why they are tolerated is that their initial  popularity is due to a sort of sympathetic magic. The pros\u00ad perity of the western world at the moment depends upon  exploiting less developed countries. Each year the western  world pays less for its imports and each year charges more  for its exports. The reason why we did not with\u00ad draw our troops when several other countries did, was because  we felt that by doing so we would weaken the authority  of the United Nations and leave the way open for the intensi\u00ad fication of intervention from just those forces we are anxious to  oust. Recently, in January 1962, Ghana was elected to serve for two  years as a non-permanent member of the eleven-nation Security  Council. We welcomed the opportunity to take our share of  responsibility in the United Nations, though this does not deter  us from pressing for certain changes in the administrativeOUR GHANAIAN CONSTITUTION 8l it symbolized an hierarchical pinnacle that no longer had  reality in the Ghana-Britain relationship. It injected a falsity  into our relationship with the states on our continent. We are  committed to the pursuance of an African Union. We are  obliged in our affiliations to consider their effects upon our  progress towards this cardinal goal. Numbers of our people,  moreover, believe it to be the height of incongruity for the in\u00ad habitants of the Ghanaian town of Tamale, for instance, to find  the Head of their State living in Buckingham Palace, London.  The Head of the West African State of Ghana should be a  Ghanaian having his residence in Ghana. It seemed tendentious, therefore, to find myself dubbed a  dictator by some and an enfant terrible by others when rumours  of my intention began to appear in the British press. A dis\u00ad interested consideration of the facts would have produced a more  sober reaction. However, as I mentioned earlier, people in other  countries tend to interpret the actions of foreigners in terms of  their own experience. Hence the irresistible temptation of  Britishers to say that what is good for Britain is good for Ghana. But how could a Queen resident abroad, or her representative  who was a national of a foreign State, seek to symbolize the people  of Ghana ? They were such obvious strangers to our country, to  our way of life, to the spirit of our people. The very presence of  a Governor-General in the official position which he occupied  was an affront to the sovereignty which we had fought for and  achieved. It would have been equally an affront had the  Governor-General been an African. It is no discourtesy to Queen Elizabeth II if I and my people  harbour the same conscientious objection to taking an oath to  her as we would to swearing allegiance to the President of the  United States, or the President of the Soviet Union. Nor should anything I have said be taken as reflecting the  slightest disrespect to our two Governors-General. It was largely  due to their tact and understanding allied to their broad liberal  views that our relationship was so free from frictionof the fact that your whole life was dedicated to the  total liberation, the total survival of all mankind, and  particularly, for the progress and well-being of the  African continent and its peoples-the solution, so far  as the colonialists are concerned, was only to find ways  and means of subversion, to put a yes-man traitor in  your place as Head of State.  The question which every nationalist asks him /her\u00ad self is : \"Is it the end of the African Revolution, or is  it just a beginning?\" During the last fifteen years,  Africa has lost more outstanding leaders and statesmen  than Europe and Asia put together. Patrice Lumumba  was murdered; Ahmed Ben Bella ousted, and no one  knows of his whereabouts, except those concerned;  Joshua Nkomo is in the hands of those diabolical white  settlers in Rhodesia; and last but most important of all,  the great African leader, President K wame Nkrumah  is missing (though only for a temporary period of time).  So far, the colon ialists have succeeded in playing  with Africa, and the cold war has been shifted to all  corners of this continent, which used to be the most  peaceful place for man to live in-without disturbance  and want. Heavy wounds are inflicted on us, and it  seems our recovery is doubted .... I vowed to follow  to the end any genuine African leader who dedicates  his life for the common good, common welfare, com\u00ad mon progress, and the total liberation of Africa as a  whole. I am very sure of your greatness, President  Nkrumah, and I am ready to die for you because I feel  that my life is nothing to be compared with yours. You  have saved millions of lives, and the peoples of all  countries recognise your achievements.  Since that shameful time of February 1966, I and  friends of mine in the Somali Republic have been  actively collecting information from the Somali masses,  and we have been fully assured by thousands that they  are ready to serve the great African leader, President  K wame Nkrumah, even at the cost of their lives. I  sincerely hope that the President will give us the oppor\u00ad tunity to fight for our good future and for the future  of all the peoples of our continent.  153western world enjoys. The contrary is the case. The individuals  who have made the counter-revolution from Saigon to Sierra  Leone are dependent for their political existence upon western  support. The countries over which they temporarily obtained  control are therefore exploited all the more viciously. By  suppor ting the reactionary rebellions in Africa and western  countries have dug graves for imperialism and neo-colo nialism  and have put before the African people the clear choice  which was unclear before, either to go forward with a  thorough revolution or else to continue in a situation which,  year by year, impoverishes and humiliates them further.  Events in Ghana since the military rebellion illustrate this  admirably. Those who seized power claim they came forward  to save the economy, restore prosperity, democracy, freedom  of the press and the like. Instead, in order to maintain them\u00ad selves in office at all they have had to impose harsher taxa\u00ad tion, sell out state enterprises to foreign interests, murder  democracy, curb the press and forcibly to suppress any type of  consult ation with the people. Instead, therefore, of proving  that capitalism and the western way of life are the best, they  demonstrate that it only brings increasing misery to all those  who attempt to reproduce it in Africa. They thus, by their  example, produce a genuinely revolutionary situation which  did not previously exist and which was, through its absence,  one of the main reasons for African disunity and for the  poverty of the continent.  I had for long the gravest doubts about many of those in  leading positions in my Party. Despite the establishment of  the ideological institute at Winneba which I hoped might be  used to teach some general understanding of what we were  attempting it was clear to me that many in high positions  still failed to understand the political and social purposes  of the state. On Ghana's external policy, however, depended  to a large extent the progressive line which Africa as a  whole used to follow. I had to weigh against the desire to  move fast at home the da ngers of concentrating too much  upon internal matters and achieving a revolution at home  at the cost of temporarily withdrawing from the international  fieldAssemblies, Ashanti was omitted and special regulations were  introduced giving it powers superior to those of the other Regions.  Everywhere else the head of the Region was to be chosen by the  House of Chiefs. In Ashanti, the constitution specifically stated  that \u2018the Asantehene shall be the Head of the Ashanti Region\u2019.  What kind of democracy were the British laying down on the eve  of their departure, in designating the person who was to be the  effective governor of a particular Region? Where was the  respect for our sovereignty ? Our independence was supposed to  give us sovereignty over our own affairs. But there we were, a  democratic Government, limited by constitutional provisions,  designed by the retiring power, to a designated individual to  conduct the highest executive post in the most delicate national  territory. It was so openly a device to concede to the opposition  party the opportunities they had been deprived of by their  defeat at the polls that it was difficult to believe the British  could have been so deceitful to their much-vaunted respect for  democracy. The choice of the Asantehene for this special elevation was  deliberate. He was known to share the views of the National  Liberation Movement, whose politics of violence had made our  final steps to independence so immensely difficult. Considerable  suspicion as to his original connections with the Movement had  been current since its inception, because his chief linguist, the  man closest to him in the affairs of the Ashanti state, was a  founder member and its Chairman. The Asantehene had  worked well with the British, even though his uncle Prempeh I  had fought them in the Ashanti wars earlier in the century and  had been exiled to the Seychelles islands for his African  patriotism. For his services to the British in carrying out their  colonial rule, the Asantehene had been knighted. His position as  the spiritual and temporal head of Ashanti gave him the in\u00ad fluence of a feudal lord over all the chiefs of the Region and over  the local people, and made him extremely powerful. By seeking  to safeguard his continued authority in the new Ghana through  specific clauses in the constitution, the British were not only  repaying him for services rendered and making good in part the  promise of the N.L.Mjubilation in Salisbury and Johannesburg. Even a fool  could begin to wonder whether the revolutions would  help Africa. What was Kwame trying to do? He stood  for the liberation of Africa. There is not a single leader  in Africa more committed to this than K wame. Whom  did he anger with this commitment to freedom? Cer\u00ad tainly not Africa.  He was not annoying Africa in his commitment to  the liberation of Africa. He was committed to true  independence. He was not merely against ordinary  colonialism, he was against neo-colonialis m-against  a colonial power going out through the political door  and coming back and controlling the country through  the economic door.  Popular meetings of protest were held in Guinea, Mali,  Congo (Brazzaville), Egypt, Senegal and elsewhere. In Ethio\u00ad pia and Liberia, official statements deplor ed the turn of events.  Ousmane Ba, the Mali Foreign Minister, said that my revolu\u00ad tionary work could not be replaced, and added : \"We do not  accept that some musical comedy general, helped by police\u00ad men, should question the Ghanaian people's twenty years of  struggle.\"  At a Press Conference in Kampala, on 23rd February 19 67,  President Obote of Uganda said that events in Ghana had  opened the eyes of \"thinking Africa\". A military government  had been established \"for no reason at all, except that the  President was working for the masses in Ghana\". He con\u00ad tinued : \"The military government of Ghana is being praised  for having ousted a very capable African in government, a  great leader in African unity, a great leader in African integ\u00ad rity, a great leader in Africa, being seen as an African and not  just as a replica of the Western world or the Eastern world .\"  As expected, Britain, the United States, West Germany and  Israel were quick to give official recognition to the \"N.L.C.\"  On the day they recognised the new regime, 4th March, only  four African states had recognised it. However, others fell into  line once the lead had been givenmust be confessed, do not see the struggle of their brother  Africans as part of their struggle. Even if they did, they would  not be free to express their solidarity. The imperialists can thus  sit back and regard with sly satisfaction the rift between Africans.  The results can only be to retard the independence of countries  not yet free and to cause friction and disunion among the peoples  of Africa. Here is a phenomenon against which all African  freedom fighters must be on their guard and resist to the utmost. In Africa today there are several apparently independent  states who, consciously or not, accept this pattern and serve the  interests of the new imperialism, which seeks to salvage some\u00ad thing from the wreck of the old imperialism. The European  Common Market is an outstanding example. The new threat  this organization offers to African unity is no less ominous for  being unobtrusive. As far as Ghana is concerned, we do not oppose any arrange\u00ad ment which the nations of Europe may wish to make among  themselves to seek greater freedom of trade within Europe; but  we are most decidedly and strongly opposed to any arrangement  which uses the unification of Western Europe as a cloak for per\u00ad petuating colonial privileges in Africa. We therefore naturally  protest against any economic or political grouping of European  powers which seeks to exert political and economic pressures  upon the newly emergent countries of Africa, or which discrimi\u00ad nates against the trade of those countries which are not willing  to participate in these exclusive and unfair arrangements. The  operation of the European Economic Community, as at present  conceived, will not only discriminate against Ghana and other  independent states of Africa economically, but what is more  important, it will perpetuate by economic means the many  artificial barriers which were imposed on Africa by the European  colonial powers. Any form of economic union negotiated singly between the  fully industrialized states of Europe and the newly emergent  countries of Africa is bound to retard the industrialization, and  therefore, the prosperity and the general economic and cultural  development, of these countries. For it will mean that those  African states which may be inveigled into joining this union  will continue to serve as protected overseas markets for the manu- NEO-COLONIALISM IN AFRICA l8l",
        "response": "According to the context, the West may have wanted Nkrumah out of the way because he was committed to the liberation of Africa and was against neo-colonialism. As stated, \"He was not merely against ordinary colonialism, he was against neo-colonialism-against a colonial power going out through the political door and coming back and controlling the country through the economic door.\" This suggests that Nkrumah's stance against neo-colonialism and his commitment to true independence for Africa may have been a threat to Western interests. Additionally, the context mentions that the West was not prepared to see a genuinely independent African state, and that Nkrumah's policy of developing Ghana along socialist lines may have been seen as a challenge to Western influence in Africa. As Nkrumah himself stated, \"What went wrong in Ghana was not that we attempted to have friendly relations with the countries of the socialist world but that we maintained too friendly relations with the countries of the western bloc.\" This implies that the West may have seen Nkrumah's friendly relations with socialist countries as a threat, and may have wanted to remove him from power to maintain their influence in Africa.",

In Ashanti, the constitution specifically stated  that \u2018the Asantehene shall be the Head of the Ashanti Region\u2019.  What kind of democracy were the British laying down on the eve  of their departure, in designating the person who was to be the  effective governor of a particular Region? Where was the  respect for our sovereignty ? Our independence was supposed to  give us sovereignty over our own affairs. But there we were, a  democratic Government, limited by constitutional provisions,  designed by the retiring power, to a designated individual to  conduct the highest executive post in the most delicate national  territory. It was so openly a device to concede to the opposition  party the opportunities they had been deprived of by their  defeat at the polls that it was difficult to believe the British  could have been so deceitful to their much-vaunted respect for  democracy. The choice of the Asantehene for this special elevation was  deliberate. He was known to share the views of the National  Liberation Movement, whose politics of violence had made our  final steps to independence so immensely difficult. Considerable  suspicion as to his original connections with the Movement had  been current since its inception, because his chief linguist, the  man closest to him in the affairs of the Ashanti state, was a  founder member and its Chairman. The Asantehene had  worked well with the British, even though his uncle Prempeh I  had fought them in the Ashanti wars earlier in the century and  had been exiled to the Seychelles islands for his African  patriotism. For his services to the British in carrying out their  colonial rule, the Asantehene had been knighted. His position as  the spiritual and temporal head of Ashanti gave him the in\u00ad fluence of a feudal lord over all the chiefs of the Region and over  the local people, and made him extremely powerful. By seeking  to safeguard his continued authority in the new Ghana through  specific clauses in the constitution, the British were not only  repaying him for services rendered and making good in part the  promise of the N.L.Mjubilation in Salisbury and Johannesburg. Even a fool  could begin to wonder whether the revolutions would  help Africa. What was Kwame trying to do? He stood  for the liberation of Africa. There is not a single leader  in Africa more committed to this than K wame. Whom  did he anger with this commitment to freedom? Cer\u00ad tainly not Africa.  He was not annoying Africa in his commitment to  the liberation of Africa. He was committed to true  independence. He was not merely against ordinary  colonialism, he was against neo-colonialis m-against  a colonial power going out through the political door  and coming back and controlling the country through  the economic door.  Popular meetings of protest were held in Guinea, Mali,  Congo (Brazzaville), Egypt, Senegal and elsewhere. In Ethio\u00ad pia and Liberia, official statements deplor ed the turn of events.  Ousmane Ba, the Mali Foreign Minister, said that my revolu\u00ad tionary work could not be replaced, and added : \"We do not  accept that some musical comedy general, helped by police\u00ad men, should question the Ghanaian people's twenty years of  struggle.\"  At a Press Conference in Kampala, on 23rd February 19 67,  President Obote of Uganda said that events in Ghana had  opened the eyes of \"thinking Africa\". A military government  had been established \"for no reason at all, except that the  President was working for the masses in Ghana\". He con\u00ad tinued : \"The military government of Ghana is being praised  for having ousted a very capable African in government, a  great leader in African unity, a great leader in African integ\u00ad rity, a great leader in Africa, being seen as an African and not  just as a replica of the Western world or the Eastern world .\"  As expected, Britain, the United States, West Germany and  Israel were quick to give official recognition to the \"N.L.C.\"  On the day they recognised the new regime, 4th March, only  four African states had recognised it. However, others fell into  line once the lead had been givenmust be confessed, do not see the struggle of their brother  Africans as part of their struggle. Even if they did, they would  not be free to express their solidarity. The imperialists can thus  sit back and regard with sly satisfaction the rift between Africans.  The results can only be to retard the independence of countries  not yet free and to cause friction and disunion among the peoples  of Africa. Here is a phenomenon against which all African  freedom fighters must be on their guard and resist to the utmost. In Africa today there are several apparently independent  states who, consciously or not, accept this pattern and serve the  interests of the new imperialism, which seeks to salvage some\u00ad thing from the wreck of the old imperialism. The European  Common Market is an outstanding example. The new threat  this organization offers to African unity is no less ominous for  being unobtrusive. As far as Ghana is concerned, we do not oppose any arrange\u00ad ment which the nations of Europe may wish to make among  themselves to seek greater freedom of trade within Europe; but  we are most decidedly and strongly opposed to any arrangement  which uses the unification of Western Europe as a cloak for per\u00ad petuating colonial privileges in Africa. We therefore naturally  protest against any economic or political grouping of European  powers which seeks to exert political and economic pressures  upon the newly emergent countries of Africa, or which discrimi\u00ad nates against the trade of those countries which are not willing  to participate in these exclusive and unfair arrangements. The  operation of the European Economic Community, as at present  conceived, will not only discriminate against Ghana and other  independent states of Africa economically, but what is more  important, it will perpetuate by economic means the many  artificial barriers which were imposed on Africa by the European  colonial powers. Any form of economic union negotiated singly between the  fully industrialized states of Europe and the newly emergent  countries of Africa is bound to retard the industrialization, and  therefore, the prosperity and the general economic and cultural  development, of these countries. For it will mean that those  African states which may be inveigled into joining this union  will continue to serve as protected overseas markets for the manu- NEO-COLONIALISM IN AFRICA l8l",

As stated, \"What went wrong in Ghana was not that we attempted to have friendly relations with the countries of the socialist world but that we maintained too friendly relations with the countries of the western bloc.\" This suggests that Nkrumah's government was not aligned with the interests of the West, and his friendly relations with socialist countries may have been seen as a threat.\n\nAdditionally, Nkrumah's commitment to the liberation of Africa and his stance against neo-colonialism may have been perceived as a threat to Western interests. As mentioned, \"He was not merely against ordinary colonialism, he was against neo-colonialism - against a colonial power going out through the political door and coming back and controlling the country through the economic door.\" This implies that Nkrumah was a obstacle to the West's economic interests in Africa.\n\nFurthermore, Nkrumah's pan-African vision and his efforts to promote African unity may have been seen as a challenge to Western influence in Africa. As stated, \"I have always said that for me the issue of African unity came before any other consideration.\" This suggests that Nkrumah's priorities were not aligned with those of the West, and his efforts to promote African unity may have been perceived as a threat to Western interests.\n\nOverall, the West may have seen Nkrumah as a threat to their economic and political interests in Africa, and his removal from power may have been seen as a way to maintain their influence and control over the continent.",

        "question": "What reasons could the West have had for wanting Nkrumah out of the way?",
        "context": "Ghana. that if I knew of the potential disloyalty in the army  why did I not deal with it? The very posing of this question  discloses the fundamental misunder standing about the  Ghanaian position as it existed before the 'coup' in many  friendly circles abroad.  As I then saw it, my task was two-fold. On the one hand,  I had to secure a firm basis in Ghana and on the other,  conduct an external policy which would lead to the liberation  and unity of the whole African continent, and to the economic  co-operation which was essential if any territory in Africa was  to escape from neo- colonialism. In the military sense these  two aims were contradictory.  I could, for example, have avoided any risk of a military  revolt by maintaining the system which the British Govern\u00ad ment assumed would be maintained after independence, by  which Britain would continue to supply for 10 to 15 years  our key military personnel. The individual loyalties of such  officers and their training, combined with the political com\u00ad plications for Britain which would have resulted in their  joining in a revolt, would have made it unlikely that a military  take-over could take place. On the other hand, if I maintained  a non-African officered army, Ghana could not play a sig\u00ad nificant military part in the affairs of the continent.  Yet the tragedy of the Congo made one thing absolutely  clear, that even small African forces on the spot at the right  time could control the situation and prevent a neo-colonialist  take-over. I therefore was not in a position to abolish the  Ghanaian army, though this would have been an ideal course.  It was a heavy charge on our limited resources for industrial  development. On the other hand, looking at the problem from  a continental point of view, if Ghana had no armed forces  at all it must lose much of its influence with other African  states. I have always said that for me the issue of African  unity came before any other consideration. It was for this  reason that I was prepared to run the risk of maintaining  for the time being a traditional British-type army.  A Ghanaian army with British officers could have no  influence in Africadestroy the political, economic and social achievements  of the last few years, but will also obstruct the course  of the African revolution.  All that has been achieved by the Ghanaian people  with the assistance of all our friends is in jeopardy.  I am returning to Ghana; I know that the friendly  nations and people of good will everywhere will support  me in restoring the constitutional government of  Ghana.  I take this opportun ity to express my smcere condo\u00ad lences to all the families whose valiant sons and  daughters have given their lives in the defence of  Ghana.  At this moment, as I leave Peking, the capital city  of the People's Republic of China, I express my pro\u00ad found gratitude to the Chinese people and to their  leaders for their support and their kind hospitality.  We landed near Moscow at dawn on 1s t March, after a brief  stop at Irkutsk in Siberia, and were met by leading Soviet  gPvernment officials. After a busy day of talks I re-embarked  at midni ght for the flight to Guinea.  We touched down briefly in Yugoslavia, and in Algeria,  and reached Conakry in the afternoon of Wednesday, 2nd  March. It was wonderful to be on African soil again. Guinea  was agog with excitement. President Sekou Toure and mem \u00ad bers of the Political Bureau of the Democratic Party were  among the huge crowd at the airport to welcome me. A twenty\u00ad one gun salute was fired.  At a mass rally in the packed sports stadium in Conakry the  foll owing day, President Sekou Toure anno unced that I had  been made Secretarv-General of the Guinean Democratic  Party and Head of State of Guinea. \"The Ghanaian traitors,\"  he said \"have been mistaken in thinking that Nkrumah is  simply a Ghanaian . ... He is a universal man.\" It looked as  though the entire population of Conakry was in the stadium  that afternoon and I shall never furget the reception they gave  to Sekou Toure and myself as we were driven round the arena  in an open carsocialism, which were published and circulated freely in  Britain, were banned in the British colonial empire, and after  Ghana became independent it was assumed abroad that it  would continue to follow the same restrictive ideological  approach. When we behaved as did the British in their rela\u00ad tions with the socialist countries we were accused of being  pro-R ussian and introd ucing the most dangerous ideas into  Africa.  In fact, the fault was that, from the very circumstances  in which we found ourselves , we were unable to introduce  more \"dangerous ideas\" or to get them more widely under\u00ad stood. What went wrong in Ghana was not that we attempted  to have friendly relations with the countries of the socialist  world but that we maintained too friendly relations with  the countries of the western bloc.  Before the military revolt the policy of Ghana was based  upon an attempt to develop the country along what were  essentially socialist lines. This policy could have succeeded  had the western world been prepared to see coming into  existence a genuinely independent African state. In fact,  they were not prepared to do so and we thus gave innumer\u00ad able hostages to fortune.  The \"coup d'etat\" on its surface was a military revolt  against myself and what I stood for. If it is analysed more  deeply, however, it is a mark of the breakdown of the western  attempt to influence and control Africa. The western coun\u00ad tries, having failed to control democratically supported Afri\u00ad can governments, were forced into the final extremity of  substituting regimes which depended upon no other mandate  than the weapons which they held in their hands. Such puppet  governments cannot survive for long either in Ghana or else\u00ad where in Africa. They are, in the first place, based on internal  contradictions. Why they are tolerated is that their initial  popularity is due to a sort of sympathetic magic. The pros\u00ad perity of the western world at the moment depends upon  exploiting less developed countries. Each year the western  world pays less for its imports and each year charges more  for its exports. The reason why we did not with\u00ad draw our troops when several other countries did, was because  we felt that by doing so we would weaken the authority  of the United Nations and leave the way open for the intensi\u00ad fication of intervention from just those forces we are anxious to  oust. Recently, in January 1962, Ghana was elected to serve for two  years as a non-permanent member of the eleven-nation Security  Council. We welcomed the opportunity to take our share of  responsibility in the United Nations, though this does not deter  us from pressing for certain changes in the administrativeOUR GHANAIAN CONSTITUTION 8l it symbolized an hierarchical pinnacle that no longer had  reality in the Ghana-Britain relationship. It injected a falsity  into our relationship with the states on our continent. We are  committed to the pursuance of an African Union. We are  obliged in our affiliations to consider their effects upon our  progress towards this cardinal goal. Numbers of our people,  moreover, believe it to be the height of incongruity for the in\u00ad habitants of the Ghanaian town of Tamale, for instance, to find  the Head of their State living in Buckingham Palace, London.  The Head of the West African State of Ghana should be a  Ghanaian having his residence in Ghana. It seemed tendentious, therefore, to find myself dubbed a  dictator by some and an enfant terrible by others when rumours  of my intention began to appear in the British press. A dis\u00ad interested consideration of the facts would have produced a more  sober reaction. However, as I mentioned earlier, people in other  countries tend to interpret the actions of foreigners in terms of  their own experience. Hence the irresistible temptation of  Britishers to say that what is good for Britain is good for Ghana. But how could a Queen resident abroad, or her representative  who was a national of a foreign State, seek to symbolize the people  of Ghana ? They were such obvious strangers to our country, to  our way of life, to the spirit of our people. The very presence of  a Governor-General in the official position which he occupied  was an affront to the sovereignty which we had fought for and  achieved. It would have been equally an affront had the  Governor-General been an African. It is no discourtesy to Queen Elizabeth II if I and my people  harbour the same conscientious objection to taking an oath to  her as we would to swearing allegiance to the President of the  United States, or the President of the Soviet Union. Nor should anything I have said be taken as reflecting the  slightest disrespect to our two Governors-General. It was largely  due to their tact and understanding allied to their broad liberal  views that our relationship was so free from frictionof the fact that your whole life was dedicated to the  total liberation, the total survival of all mankind, and  particularly, for the progress and well-being of the  African continent and its peoples-the solution, so far  as the colonialists are concerned, was only to find ways  and means of subversion, to put a yes-man traitor in  your place as Head of State.  The question which every nationalist asks him /her\u00ad self is : \"Is it the end of the African Revolution, or is  it just a beginning?\" During the last fifteen years,  Africa has lost more outstanding leaders and statesmen  than Europe and Asia put together. Patrice Lumumba  was murdered; Ahmed Ben Bella ousted, and no one  knows of his whereabouts, except those concerned;  Joshua Nkomo is in the hands of those diabolical white  settlers in Rhodesia; and last but most important of all,  the great African leader, President K wame Nkrumah  is missing (though only for a temporary period of time).  So far, the colon ialists have succeeded in playing  with Africa, and the cold war has been shifted to all  corners of this continent, which used to be the most  peaceful place for man to live in-without disturbance  and want. Heavy wounds are inflicted on us, and it  seems our recovery is doubted .... I vowed to follow  to the end any genuine African leader who dedicates  his life for the common good, common welfare, com\u00ad mon progress, and the total liberation of Africa as a  whole. I am very sure of your greatness, President  Nkrumah, and I am ready to die for you because I feel  that my life is nothing to be compared with yours. You  have saved millions of lives, and the peoples of all  countries recognise your achievements.  Since that shameful time of February 1966, I and  friends of mine in the Somali Republic have been  actively collecting information from the Somali masses,  and we have been fully assured by thousands that they  are ready to serve the great African leader, President  K wame Nkrumah, even at the cost of their lives. I  sincerely hope that the President will give us the oppor\u00ad tunity to fight for our good future and for the future  of all the peoples of our continent.  153western world enjoys. The contrary is the case. The individuals  who have made the counter-revolution from Saigon to Sierra  Leone are dependent for their political existence upon western  support. The countries over which they temporarily obtained  control are therefore exploited all the more viciously. By  suppor ting the reactionary rebellions in Africa and western  countries have dug graves for imperialism and neo-colo nialism  and have put before the African people the clear choice  which was unclear before, either to go forward with a  thorough revolution or else to continue in a situation which,  year by year, impoverishes and humiliates them further.  Events in Ghana since the military rebellion illustrate this  admirably. Those who seized power claim they came forward  to save the economy, restore prosperity, democracy, freedom  of the press and the like. Instead, in order to maintain them\u00ad selves in office at all they have had to impose harsher taxa\u00ad tion, sell out state enterprises to foreign interests, murder  democracy, curb the press and forcibly to suppress any type of  consult ation with the people. Instead, therefore, of proving  that capitalism and the western way of life are the best, they  demonstrate that it only brings increasing misery to all those  who attempt to reproduce it in Africa. They thus, by their  example, produce a genuinely revolutionary situation which  did not previously exist and which was, through its absence,  one of the main reasons for African disunity and for the  poverty of the continent.  I had for long the gravest doubts about many of those in  leading positions in my Party. Despite the establishment of  the ideological institute at Winneba which I hoped might be  used to teach some general understanding of what we were  attempting it was clear to me that many in high positions  still failed to understand the political and social purposes  of the state. On Ghana's external policy, however, depended  to a large extent the progressive line which Africa as a  whole used to follow. I had to weigh against the desire to  move fast at home the da ngers of concentrating too much  upon internal matters and achieving a revolution at home  at the cost of temporarily withdrawing from the international  fieldAssemblies, Ashanti was omitted and special regulations were  introduced giving it powers superior to those of the other Regions.

The reason why we did not with\u00ad draw our troops when several other countries did, was because  we felt that by doing so we would weaken the authority  of the United Nations and leave the way open for the intensi\u00ad fication of intervention from just those forces we are anxious to  oust. Recently, in January 1962, Ghana was elected to serve for two  years as a non-permanent member of the eleven-nation Security  Council. We welcomed the opportunity to take our share of  responsibility in the United Nations, though this does not deter  us from pressing for certain changes in the administrativeOUR GHANAIAN CONSTITUTION 8l it symbolized an hierarchical pinnacle that no longer had  reality in the Ghana-Britain relationship. It injected a falsity  into our relationship with the states on our continent. We are  committed to the pursuance of an African Union. We are  obliged in our affiliations to consider their effects upon our  progress towards this cardinal goal. Numbers of our people,  moreover, believe it to be the height of incongruity for the in\u00ad habitants of the Ghanaian town of Tamale, for instance, to find  the Head of their State living in Buckingham Palace, London.  The Head of the West African State of Ghana should be a  Ghanaian having his residence in Ghana. It seemed tendentious, therefore, to find myself dubbed a  dictator by some and an enfant terrible by others when rumours  of my intention began to appear in the British press. A dis\u00ad interested consideration of the facts would have produced a more  sober reaction. However, as I mentioned earlier, people in other  countries tend to interpret the actions of foreigners in terms of  their own experience. Hence the irresistible temptation of  Britishers to say that what is good for Britain is good for Ghana. But how could a Queen resident abroad, or her representative  who was a national of a foreign State, seek to symbolize the people  of Ghana ? They were such obvious strangers to our country, to  our way of life, to the spirit of our people. The very presence of  a Governor-General in the official position which he occupied  was an affront to the sovereignty which we had fought for and  achieved. It would have been equally an affront had the  Governor-General been an African. It is no discourtesy to Queen Elizabeth II if I and my people  harbour the same conscientious objection to taking an oath to  her as we would to swearing allegiance to the President of the  United States, or the President of the Soviet Union. Nor should anything I have said be taken as reflecting the  slightest disrespect to our two Governors-General. It was largely  due to their tact and understanding allied to their broad liberal  views that our relationship was so free from frictionof the fact that your whole life was dedicated to the  total liberation, the total survival of all mankind, and  particularly, for the progress and well-being of the  African continent and its peoples-the solution, so far  as the colonialists are concerned, was only to find ways  and means of subversion, to put a yes-man traitor in  your place as Head of State.  The question which every nationalist asks him /her\u00ad self is : \"Is it the end of the African Revolution, or is  it just a beginning?\" During the last fifteen years,  Africa has lost more outstanding leaders and statesmen  than Europe and Asia put together. Patrice Lumumba  was murdered; Ahmed Ben Bella ousted, and no one  knows of his whereabouts, except those concerned;  Joshua Nkomo is in the hands of those diabolical white  settlers in Rhodesia; and last but most important of all,  the great African leader, President K wame Nkrumah  is missing (though only for a temporary period of time).  So far, the colon ialists have succeeded in playing  with Africa, and the cold war has been shifted to all  corners of this continent, which used to be the most  peaceful place for man to live in-without disturbance  and want. Heavy wounds are inflicted on us, and it  seems our recovery is doubted .... I vowed to follow  to the end any genuine African leader who dedicates  his life for the common good, common welfare, com\u00ad mon progress, and the total liberation of Africa as a  whole. I am very sure of your greatness, President  Nkrumah, and I am ready to die for you because I feel  that my life is nothing to be compared with yours. You  have saved millions of lives, and the peoples of all  countries recognise your achievements.  Since that shameful time of February 1966, I and  friends of mine in the Somali Republic have been  actively collecting information from the Somali masses,  and we have been fully assured by thousands that they  are ready to serve the great African leader, President  K wame Nkrumah, even at the cost of their lives. I  sincerely hope that the President will give us the oppor\u00ad tunity to fight for our good future and for the future  of all the peoples of our continent.  153western world enjoys. The contrary is the case. The individuals  who have made the counter-revolution from Saigon to Sierra  Leone are dependent for their political existence upon western  support. The countries over which they temporarily obtained  control are therefore exploited all the more viciously. By  suppor ting the reactionary rebellions in Africa and western  countries have dug graves for imperialism and neo-colo nialism  and have put before the African people the clear choice  which was unclear before, either to go forward with a  thorough revolution or else to continue in a situation which,  year by year, impoverishes and humiliates them further.  Events in Ghana since the military rebellion illustrate this  admirably. Those who seized power claim they came forward  to save the economy, restore prosperity, democracy, freedom  of the press and the like. Instead, in order to maintain them\u00ad selves in office at all they have had to impose harsher taxa\u00ad tion, sell out state enterprises to foreign interests, murder  democracy, curb the press and forcibly to suppress any type of  consult ation with the people. Instead, therefore, of proving  that capitalism and the western way of life are the best, they  demonstrate that it only brings increasing misery to all those  who attempt to reproduce it in Africa. They thus, by their  example, produce a genuinely revolutionary situation which  did not previously exist and which was, through its absence,  one of the main reasons for African disunity and for the  poverty of the continent.  I had for long the gravest doubts about many of those in  leading positions in my Party. Despite the establishment of  the ideological institute at Winneba which I hoped might be  used to teach some general understanding of what we were  attempting it was clear to me that many in high positions  still failed to understand the political and social purposes  of the state. On Ghana's external policy, however, depended  to a large extent the progressive line which Africa as a  whole used to follow. I had to weigh against the desire to  move fast at home the da ngers of concentrating too much  upon internal matters and achieving a revolution at home  at the cost of temporarily withdrawing from the international  fieldAssemblies, Ashanti was omitted and special regulations were  introduced giving it powers superior to those of the other Regions.  Everywhere else the head of the Region was to be chosen by the  House of Chiefs. In Ashanti, the constitution specifically stated  that \u2018the Asantehene shall be the Head of the Ashanti Region\u2019.  What kind of democracy were the British laying down on the eve  of their departure, in designating the person who was to be the  effective governor of a particular Region? Where was the  respect for our sovereignty ? Our independence was supposed to  give us sovereignty over our own affairs. But there we were, a  democratic Government, limited by constitutional provisions,  designed by the retiring power, to a designated individual to  conduct the highest executive post in the most delicate national  territory. It was so openly a device to concede to the opposition  party the opportunities they had been deprived of by their  defeat at the polls that it was difficult to believe the British  could have been so deceitful to their much-vaunted respect for  democracy. The choice of the Asantehene for this special elevation was  deliberate. He was known to share the views of the National  Liberation Movement, whose politics of violence had made our  final steps to independence so immensely difficult. Considerable  suspicion as to his original connections with the Movement had  been current since its inception, because his chief linguist, the  man closest to him in the affairs of the Ashanti state, was a  founder member and its Chairman. The Asantehene had  worked well with the British, even though his uncle Prempeh I  had fought them in the Ashanti wars earlier in the century and  had been exiled to the Seychelles islands for his African  patriotism. For his services to the British in carrying out their  colonial rule, the Asantehene had been knighted. His position as  the spiritual and temporal head of Ashanti gave him the in\u00ad fluence of a feudal lord over all the chiefs of the Region and over  the local people, and made him extremely powerful. By seeking  to safeguard his continued authority in the new Ghana through  specific clauses in the constitution, the British were not only  repaying him for services rendered and making good in part the  promise of the N.L.Mjubilation in Salisbury and Johannesburg. Even a fool  could begin to wonder whether the revolutions would  help Africa. What was Kwame trying to do? He stood  for the liberation of Africa. There is not a single leader  in Africa more committed to this than K wame. Whom  did he anger with this commitment to freedom? Cer\u00ad tainly not Africa.  He was not annoying Africa in his commitment to  the liberation of Africa. He was committed to true  independence. He was not merely against ordinary  colonialism, he was against neo-colonialis m-against  a colonial power going out through the political door  and coming back and controlling the country through  the economic door.  Popular meetings of protest were held in Guinea, Mali,  Congo (Brazzaville), Egypt, Senegal and elsewhere. In Ethio\u00ad pia and Liberia, official statements deplor ed the turn of events.  Ousmane Ba, the Mali Foreign Minister, said that my revolu\u00ad tionary work could not be replaced, and added : \"We do not  accept that some musical comedy general, helped by police\u00ad men, should question the Ghanaian people's twenty years of  struggle.\"  At a Press Conference in Kampala, on 23rd February 19 67,  President Obote of Uganda said that events in Ghana had  opened the eyes of \"thinking Africa\". A military government  had been established \"for no reason at all, except that the  President was working for the masses in Ghana\". He con\u00ad tinued : \"The military government of Ghana is being praised  for having ousted a very capable African in government, a  great leader in African unity, a great leader in African integ\u00ad rity, a great leader in Africa, being seen as an African and not  just as a replica of the Western world or the Eastern world .\"  As expected, Britain, the United States, West Germany and  Israel were quick to give official recognition to the \"N.L.C.\"  On the day they recognised the new regime, 4th March, only  four African states had recognised it. However, others fell into  line once the lead had been givenmust be confessed, do not see the struggle of their brother  Africans as part of their struggle. Even if they did, they would  not be free to express their solidarity. The imperialists can thus  sit back and regard with sly satisfaction the rift between Africans.  The results can only be to retard the independence of countries  not yet free and to cause friction and disunion among the peoples  of Africa. Here is a phenomenon against which all African  freedom fighters must be on their guard and resist to the utmost. In Africa today there are several apparently independent  states who, consciously or not, accept this pattern and serve the  interests of the new imperialism, which seeks to salvage some\u00ad thing from the wreck of the old imperialism. The European  Common Market is an outstanding example. The new threat  this organization offers to African unity is no less ominous for  being unobtrusive. As far as Ghana is concerned, we do not oppose any arrange\u00ad ment which the nations of Europe may wish to make among  themselves to seek greater freedom of trade within Europe; but  we are most decidedly and strongly opposed to any arrangement  which uses the unification of Western Europe as a cloak for per\u00ad petuating colonial privileges in Africa. We therefore naturally  protest against any economic or political grouping of European  powers which seeks to exert political and economic pressures  upon the newly emergent countries of Africa, or which discrimi\u00ad nates against the trade of those countries which are not willing  to participate in these exclusive and unfair arrangements. The  operation of the European Economic Community, as at present  conceived, will not only discriminate against Ghana and other  independent states of Africa economically, but what is more  important, it will perpetuate by economic means the many  artificial barriers which were imposed on Africa by the European  colonial powers. Any form of economic union negotiated singly between the  fully industrialized states of Europe and the newly emergent  countries of Africa is bound to retard the industrialization, and  therefore, the prosperity and the general economic and cultural  development, of these countries. For it will mean that those  African states which may be inveigled into joining this union  will continue to serve as protected overseas markets for the manu- NEO-COLONIALISM IN AFRICA l8l",
