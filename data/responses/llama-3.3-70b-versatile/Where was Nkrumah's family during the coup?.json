        "question": "Where was Nkrumah's family during the coup?",
        "context": "was said, Russian planes were landing on a secret airstrip in  northern Ghana. Furthermore a secret tunnel had been made  from Flagstaff House, the presidential residence, to Accra air\u00ad port, and for days Russians had been arriving. The only way  to save Ghana, and to avoid being sent to fight in Vietnam, the  troops were told, was to take Flagstaff House.  Several days after the military seizure of power, Kotoka and  Afrifa appeared on Ghana TV congratulating themselves on  their easy success. One remark stood out unmistakable and  clear: \"And you know, we didn't find any Russians at all\u00ad not one! Nor could we find any trace of that tunnel.\" This  was followed by peals of laughter at the poor soldiers who  had believed their story.  The first object of the military operation was to force the  surrender of Major-General Barwah, Army Chief of Staff and  Deputy Chief of Defence Staff, who was in command of the  Ghana Army in the absence from the country of the Chief of  Defence Staff, General Aferi. At the same time, Brigadier  Hasan, Head of Military Intelligence, and Colonel Zanerigu,  Commander of the Presidential Guard Regiment, and Owusu\u00ad Sekyere, former head of the C.I.D. and in charge of the Special  Branch. were to be arrested.  This stage of the operation was badly bungled. Hasan was  arrested, but Zanerigu, when confronted, escaped through a  window of his house and drove to Flagstaff House to warn the  Presidential Guard Regiment. Barwah could not be intimi\u00ad dated. Woken from his sleep in the early hours of the morning  of the 24th by the arrival of Kotoka and some 25 men, he  courageously refused either to join the traitors or to surrender.  Thereupon, Kotoka shot him dead at point-black range in  cold blood in the presence of his wife and children. The  seven security officers who were stationed at Barwah's house  were also murdered on the spot on Kotoka's ordersdestroy the political, economic and social achievements  of the last few years, but will also obstruct the course  of the African revolution.  All that has been achieved by the Ghanaian people  with the assistance of all our friends is in jeopardy.  I am returning to Ghana; I know that the friendly  nations and people of good will everywhere will support  me in restoring the constitutional government of  Ghana.  I take this opportun ity to express my smcere condo\u00ad lences to all the families whose valiant sons and  daughters have given their lives in the defence of  Ghana.  At this moment, as I leave Peking, the capital city  of the People's Republic of China, I express my pro\u00ad found gratitude to the Chinese people and to their  leaders for their support and their kind hospitality.  We landed near Moscow at dawn on 1s t March, after a brief  stop at Irkutsk in Siberia, and were met by leading Soviet  gPvernment officials. After a busy day of talks I re-embarked  at midni ght for the flight to Guinea.  We touched down briefly in Yugoslavia, and in Algeria,  and reached Conakry in the afternoon of Wednesday, 2nd  March. It was wonderful to be on African soil again. Guinea  was agog with excitement. President Sekou Toure and mem \u00ad bers of the Political Bureau of the Democratic Party were  among the huge crowd at the airport to welcome me. A twenty\u00ad one gun salute was fired.  At a mass rally in the packed sports stadium in Conakry the  foll owing day, President Sekou Toure anno unced that I had  been made Secretarv-General of the Guinean Democratic  Party and Head of State of Guinea. \"The Ghanaian traitors,\"  he said \"have been mistaken in thinking that Nkrumah is  simply a Ghanaian . ... He is a universal man.\" It looked as  though the entire population of Conakry was in the stadium  that afternoon and I shall never furget the reception they gave  to Sekou Toure and myself as we were driven round the arena  in an open carthe \"heroes of the counter-revolution\", the criminal detainees.  These people assaulted women, thieved, and looted. It will  be only after the return to legal government in Ghana that  it will be possible to assess exactly the number of those who  died in fighting against the rebel soldiers or were subsequently  killed in the looting and robbery which followed. The casual\u00ad ties in the fighting were certainly heavy. The number of  civilians killed, it is more difficult to estimate. Two members  of Parliament certainly lost their lives and a number of people  in no way connected with politics died. Among those shot  dead near Flagstaff House was an air hostess on her way to  the airport. In all, the total was probably around 1, 600 dead  and many more injured . So much for the \"bloodless coup\"!  One thing is clear. Never before in the cherished history  of our new Ghana had citizens, defenceless men and women,  been assassinated in cold blood by their own soldiers. Not a  single Ghanaian life was taken during the whole fifteen years  of my administration. There are few, if any, governments  in the world which can say as much. Yet here was this  handful of traitors at one blow spoiling our proud record, and  dragging Ghana's name through the mud.  In the days which followed the insurrection, hundreds of  patriotic Ghanaians were thrown into prison. All ministers.  M.P.s , officials of the Party and of all its subsidiary and  associate organisations including the trade unions were  arrested and detained. The same applied to branch officers  throughout the country. In fact, the entire leadership, except  for the few who managed to escape or go into hiding, was  at one swoop rounded up and thrown into prison.  The prison authorities, with some exceptions, continued  to act in the humane and considerate way which we had  insisted upon in the prison service, since the establishment  of independence. The Director of Prisons, in particular, saw  to it that no one, insofar as he could prevent it, once inside  the prison, was ill-treatedcarried out the most cruel and senseless attacks on innocent  men, women and children. Thousands of pounds worth of  damage was done to government property, and valuable his\u00ad torical docume nts and records were destroyed.  At Flagstaff House itself, troops dashed from one room to  another, smashing windows and furniture, tearing up  papers, ripping telephones from desks, and destroying any\u00ad thing they could lay their hands on. My own office was singled  out for special treatment. The full extent of the loss of books  and manuscripts I shall discover on my return. I am hoping  that by some miracle the precious notes I was compiling for  a history of Africa may have been spared. If not, years of  work will have been wasted, and the labour of collecting and  sorting material and writing it up will have to begin again  from scratch.  The stupidity of this needless destru ction of government  property, and the failure of the rebel officers to exercise any  control over their men, demonstrates the quality of their  leadership.  In the six-roomed two-stor ey house where I lived with my  family, troops were allowed to run riot, seizing clothes and  other intimate personal possessions including rare old books  and manuscripts. My wife and children, although not physi\u00ad cally harmed, were not permitted to take a single thing with  them when they were turned out of the house and forced to  take refuge in the Egyptian Embassy.  My mother, 80 years old and almost blind, who was staying  at Flagstaff Hous e, was forcibly ejected and told to go \"where  you belong\". I understand some friends took her to Nkroful  where I was born. Later, the actual house in which I was born  was burnt down on \"N.L.C.\" orders.  My mother was forced to appear before a 'commission of  enquiry' with the idea of making her admit that I was not  her son and indeed was not a Ghanaian at all. I am proud  to know that she resolutely refused to say anything of the  sort and conducted herself with the utmost dignitytrained civil servants. They had made their way up through  the colonial structure. They had been among my most trusted  officials but they chose to return to Ghana, presumably in  the hope that they would be accepted by the counter\u00ad revolutionaries.  Enoch Okoh, as head of the civil service and as the person  who knew therefore which promotions had been made and  why, was treated with leniency and wa:s appointed to be in  charge of the Housing Corporation. Since the new regime  did not intend to build any houses for the people this was  perhaps the appropriate punishment for his desertion.  Michael Dei-Ana ng was not so treated and, much to his  surprise, was thrown into prison.  Fred Arkhurst, after his treachery, returned to his former  position at the United Nations but was eventually removed  by the 'N.L.C.' who could not trust someone who had, at  least, ability.  Naturally, we were all of us anxious about the safety of our  families in Ghana, but I suppose the official members of the  party were also thinking about their bank accounts and their  property. It is said that a man's heart lies where his treasure  is. But even allowing for the fact that they had more to lose  than the other personnel, I still find it hard to understand how  they could have lost grip of themselves so easily. It was as  though they had put their hands up at the first whiff of danger.  However, they did manage to pull themselves together suffi\u00ad ciently for me to be able to discuss the next moves with them.  It was not until later, after they had left Peking, and were on  their own, that the full depth of their defeatism became appar\u00ad ent, and they deserted.  We agreed that for the next day or two, while arrangements  were being made. I should carry out official engagements as  planned .  This was also the wish of the Chinese government. The  Chinese made it clear that they regarded the military and  police action in Ghana as no more than a temporary obstacle  in the long struggle against imperialismWe are not told about Ankrah's four wives and 22 children.  Kotoka, generally credited with commanding the actual  military operations on 24th February, was also trained in  Britain. In fact, all members of the \"N.L.C .\" were trained in  the U.K. The four policemen were at the Metropolitan Train\u00ad ing College in Hendon and the four soldiers at various British  army training centres, though only Afrifa, the youngest, man\u00ad aged to get to Sandhurst.  We are informed that Kotoka \"is a fine soldier, disciplined,  loyal, resolute and firm\". I must confess I am unimpressed by  his \"discipline\" and \"loyalty\".  When his name was flashed across the headlines of the  world press on 24th February, I had hardly heard of him. At  the time when I reorganised the armed forces, he came to  Flagstaff House to take the oath of allegiance to me as  Supreme Commander of the Ghana armed forces. Kotoka was  the only one late in arriving. I remember turning to Aferi,  Chief of Defence Staff at that time and asking: \"Who is this  chap?\"  As for Ocran, for a time my A.D.C., he is described as  \"rather reserved; shy of publicity\". His interests are simply  \"bird watching\". Yakubu, after a \"brilliant career in the In\u00ad spectorate\", rose gradually to the rank of Deputy Commis\u00ad sioner of Police. He is the only Northerner on the \"N.L.C.,\"  and his inclusion was doubtless for political reasons. Yet, like  his colleagues on the \"N.L.C.\", he makes no claim to either  political interests or experience. He is \"quiet and always smil\u00ad ing\" and likes to do farm work in his spare time.  Little space is given to N unooinvolved in this attempt, are ordered to return to their  barracks and wait for my return.  I am the constitutional head of the Republic of  Ghana, and the supreme commander of the armed  forces.  I am returning to Ghana soon.\"  I followed this up with a cable to all Ghanaian embassies :  \"Be calm and remain firm at your posts. Send all  messages and reports to me through the Ghana  Embassy, Peking, and not, repeat not, through Accra  until further notice.\"  As I discussed the news from Ghana with the 22 officials  accompanying me, among them A. Quaison Sackey (Foreign  Minister), Kwesi Armah (Minister of Trade), M. F. Dei\u00ad Anang (Ambassador Extraordinary, in charge of the African  Affairs Secretariat), J. E. Bossman (Ambassador to the U.K.),  F. Arkhurst (Ghana's Permanent Representative at the United  Nations), I was somewhat disappointed to note their reaction.  At a time like this, I would have expected them to show cour\u00ad age and fortitude. But most of them were frightened. Quaison  Sackey, for example, developed diarrhoea, and must have  visited the lavatory about twenty times that day. Their obvious  dismay was in striking contrast to the calmness and courage  of the 66 other personnel-the security officers and members  of my personal secretariat. These were men. Compared with  them, the politicians were old women.  With Alex Quaison Sackey, I will deal later. K wesi  Armah settled down in London where it appeared that he  had considerable funds of money available to him. The  rebel regime, on the basis of this. attempted to have him  extradited on the grounds that he had stolen the money in  question. His many trials before the English Courts exposed  at least the falsity of the allegations which these authorities  had made. I am glad that he was acquitted since I am sure  that the particular charges made against him were false.L.C.\" orders.  My mother was forced to appear before a 'commission of  enquiry' with the idea of making her admit that I was not  her son and indeed was not a Ghanaian at all. I am proud  to know that she resolutely refused to say anything of the  sort and conducted herself with the utmost dignity.  From Flagstaff House, the troops went to Kanda Estate  where many security officers have their quarters. There they  hurled grenades into the compounds, broke into houses and  flats, tossed furniture out of the windows, and carried off  radios, refrigerators and other property. Anyone who resisted  25independence but evolved a work and happiness programme of reconstruction. We also joined in the great movement for the liberation and political unification of Africa. The achievement of the Convention People's Party under my leadership is an open book. It can be seen by all, and today, anyone who visits Ghana can be a witness of this great achievement. Inter- nationally, independent Ghana has been playing her role in world affairs. She has supported peace and will always continue to support any movement that can lead to the peace and security of the world. In all this struggle, the Convention People's Party, and its Govern- ment have not shed a single drop of a Ghanaian's blood. I shuddered when I learned of the shooting and killing of defenceless men and women, and the arrest, intimidation and imprisonment of many of the leading patriots of the country. The blood of these gallant men and women cry to heaven for redress. Their blood shall not be shed in vain. Those who have died, may they rest in peace. By the arrest, detention and assassination of Ministers, the party's civil servants, trade unionists and by the blind massacre of defenceless men and women, the authors of these insane acts of robbery, violence, intimidation and assassination have added brutality to their treason. Never before in the cherished history of our new Ghana have citizens, men and women, been assassinated in cold blood and never have their children become orphans for political reasons. Never before have Ghanaians been shot down because of their political convictions. This is a tragedy of monstrous proportions. But I know your courage and determination: I see the extent of your indignation against this wanton rebellion. I know that at the appropriate time you will take the initiative to crush it. The Party's dynamism will rise up again to save your dignity and personality. As far as I am concerned I will do my very best to crush this criminal rebellionexposed themselves in their true colours for all to see. By their  very actions, on 24th February and in the months of \"N.L.C.\"  rule, they have clearly shown themselves to be traitors to their  country and the stooges of neo-colonialism. They have dis\u00ad played their reactionary nature, their complete disregard for  the common man and for the progress of the African Revolu\u00ad tion.  It is like when you boil a pot hard; all the bits and pieces of  useless stuff come to the top and you are able to skim them off  easily. It is necessary to realise, that, in many ways, the  so-called \"coup d'etat\" has not been a set-back but has been  merely a symptom of how neo-colo nialism is breaking down.  Almost all African countries came to independence without  armed struggle. This meant that it was impossible, in practice,  to reconstruct these new states upon a socialist basis  immediately. I was well aware of the compromises which  it was necessary to make and the dangers which this entailed  but Ghana's independence on any condition was the first  essential in securing the freedom of Africa. Not to have  seized independence when we had a chance of obtaining  it, whatever the liability we inherited, would have been  criminal. The circumstances under which the C.P.P. was  formed resulted in it being a compromise organisation com\u00ad posed of some genuine revolutionaries but containing many  of those who are interested in independence only so as to  better themselves and to take the place of the previous  colonial traders and businessmen. This meant that I had to  include in any government which I formed representatives  of all tendencies in the Party including businessmen on the  make such as Emmanuel Ayeh-Kumi and William Halm.  In the circumstances of the day there was at least a reason\u00b7  able chance that such people would act honestly and would  assist to build the state on a new basis.  The experiment which we tried in Ghana was essentially  one of developing the country in co-op eration with the world  as a whole. Non-alignment meant exactly what it said",
        "response": "Nkrumah's family was at Flagstaff House, the presidential residence, during the coup. His wife and children were not physically harmed but were turned out of the house and forced to take refuge in the Egyptian Embassy. His 80-year-old mother, who was almost blind and staying at Flagstaff House, was forcibly ejected and later taken to Nkroful, where Nkrumah was born.",
