        "response": "Yes, Kwame Nkrumah faced multiple assassination attempts during his time as the first Prime Minister and later President of Ghana. This is evidenced by the following statements from the context:\n\n\"In 1962, Nkrumah survived an assassination attempt when a bomb was planted in his car. The bomb was discovered and defused before it could detonate.\"\n\n\"In 1964, Nkrumah survived another assassination attempt when a grenade was thrown at his car. The grenade failed to detonate, and Nkrumah was unharmed.\"\n\nThese attempts were part of a larger pattern of political instability and opposition to Nkrumah's rule, which ultimately led to his overthrow in 1966. The context does not provide details about the perpetrators or motives behind these attempts, but it is clear that Nkrumah faced significant security threats throughout his tenure.",
