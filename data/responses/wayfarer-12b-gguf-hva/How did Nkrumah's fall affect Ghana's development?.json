        "question": "How did Nkrumah's fall affect Ghana's development?",
        "context": "of our development plans and of their implementation reveals  the truth-that it was their success and not their failure which  spurred our enemies into action. Ghana, on the threshold of  economic independence, and in the vanguard of the African  revolutionary struggle to achieve continental liberation and  unity, was too dangerous an example to the rest of Africa to  be allowed to continue under a socialist-directed government.  In the first ten years of its administration, the Ghana gov\u00ad ernment drew up the First and Second Five Year Development  Plans (19 51-19 56 and 19 59-1 964), and the Consolidation Plan,  which covered the two-year gap between these Plans (1 957- 19 59). Under these Plans the foundations were to be laid for  the modernisation and industrialisation of Ghana. A skilled  labour force was to be trained and an adequate complement  of public services built up such as transport, electricity, water  and telecommunications.  We had to work fast. Under colonial rule, foreign monopoly  interests had tied up our whole economy to suit themselves.  We had not a single industry. Our economy was dependent on  one cash crop--cocoa. Although our output of cocoa is the  largest in the world, there was not a single cocoa processing  factory.  Before we took office in 1951 there was no direct railway  between Accra and Takoradi, in those days our main port.  Passengers and freight had to travel by way of Kumasi. This  was because Kumasi was the centre of the timber and mining  ind ustries, both of which served foreign interests and were  therefore well supplied with the necessary communications.  There were few roads, and only a very rudimentary public  transport system. For the most part, people walked from place  to place. There were very few hospitals, schools or clinics.  Most of our villages lacked a piped water supply. In fact, the  nakedness of the land when my government began in 1951 has  to have been experienced to be believed.  Failure to promote the interests of our people was due to the  insatiable demands of colonial exploitationREPERCUSSIONS  The position of the \"N.L.C.\", always precarious, has been  made even more shaky by the attitude of the progressive inde\u00ad pendent states of Africa. and the exposure of the so-called  \"coup\" as counter-r evolutionary and reactionary.  As soon as the army and police traitors seized power in my  absence from Ghana, repercussions in the rest of Africa, and  overseas, showed that there was a full awareness of the under\u00ad lying political implications. Through all the smoke- screen of  lies and propaganda, the action was clearly recognised as a  blow struck by imperialists ond neo-colonialists and their  agents against socialism and the African Revolution. The  taking sides \"for\" and \"against\" showed once again the famil\u00ad iar groupings of-on the one side, those who are struggling to  achieve socialism and the total liberation and unity of the  African continent, and on the other, those who want to  maintain the status quo, and are fighting a desperate rearguard  action to halt the liberation movement.  Both sides have regarded Ghana as a key factor in the  struggle. Since independence, Ghana has thrown herself freely  and boldly into the struggle for African emancipation. We  have proclaimed our firm stand against imperialism, coloni\u00ad alism and neo-colonialism. We have unflinchingly stated that  the independence of Ghana is meaningless unless it is  linked up with the total liberation of the African continent.  Before 24th February 19 66, Ghana was a haven to which  the oppressed from all parts of Africa could come to carry on  their struggle. Freedom fighters and political refugees from  South Africa, Rhodesia, Mozambique, Angola, so-called Por\u00ad tuguese Guinea, the Cape Verde Islands, and other oppressed  colonial areas, were given hospitality and encouragement  amongst us. Ghana was to them a symbol of hope and an  inspiration. It was a centre where they could meet to discuss  common problems. and where they could organise and train.  132these difficulties were not determinant. It was no mean achieve\u00ad ment that in January 19 65, after five years as a Republic,  Ghana had 63 state enterprises and a budget of \u00a3200 million,  including a supplementary budget, for its population of nearly  eight million; while Nigeria, richer in national resources and  with a popu lation of 55 million, had a budget of \u00a378 million.  Imperialist circles have talked much about Ghana's external  debt, given as \u00a3250 million. Apart from the dubious account\u00ad ing which arrived at this conveniently round sum, a figure such  as this means nothing unless it is set in the context of the over\u00ad all Ghanaian economic situation. To implement our various  Development Plans it was necessary to borrow considerable  sums of money, but it was borrowed on the basis of building  capital assets such as the Volta dam, and over 10 0 industries  established in Ghana since independence. The government  made sure that the international agreements signed were based  on economic feasibility, and that the money borrowed could  create something lasting and beneficial not only for us in our  lifetime but for the generations to follow. Seen in the light of  Ghana's growing industries and increasing exports, her \"in\u00ad debtedness\" is put in proper perspective-as an index of the  investors' confidence in the enterprise and the management  they helped to finance. In addition, it should be noted that only  some \u00a320 million was due to be paid in 19 67, and this did not  prevent the government from refusing the political conditions  attached to a loan from the International Monetary Fund  (I.M.F.).  Long faces are pulled at the drop in our foreign reserves  since independence. In 19 57, Ghana had a sterling balance of  \u00a3200 million. This has not been \"squandered\" as the imperial\u00ad ist press would have its readers believe. It has been used to  pay off succcessive balance of payments deficits due to the  rise in prices of imported consumer goods, and the drastic  fall in the price of our main export crop-cocoa. It should be  remembered that the sterling balance was in fact a forced loan  at negligible interest which Britain acquired from Ghana  during and after the Second World WarAssemblies, Ashanti was omitted and special regulations were  introduced giving it powers superior to those of the other Regions.  Everywhere else the head of the Region was to be chosen by the  House of Chiefs. In Ashanti, the constitution specifically stated  that \u2018the Asantehene shall be the Head of the Ashanti Region\u2019.  What kind of democracy were the British laying down on the eve  of their departure, in designating the person who was to be the  effective governor of a particular Region? Where was the  respect for our sovereignty ? Our independence was supposed to  give us sovereignty over our own affairs. But there we were, a  democratic Government, limited by constitutional provisions,  designed by the retiring power, to a designated individual to  conduct the highest executive post in the most delicate national  territory. It was so openly a device to concede to the opposition  party the opportunities they had been deprived of by their  defeat at the polls that it was difficult to believe the British  could have been so deceitful to their much-vaunted respect for  democracy. The choice of the Asantehene for this special elevation was  deliberate. He was known to share the views of the National  Liberation Movement, whose politics of violence had made our  final steps to independence so immensely difficult. Considerable  suspicion as to his original connections with the Movement had  been current since its inception, because his chief linguist, the  man closest to him in the affairs of the Ashanti state, was a  founder member and its Chairman. The Asantehene had  worked well with the British, even though his uncle Prempeh I  had fought them in the Ashanti wars earlier in the century and  had been exiled to the Seychelles islands for his African  patriotism. For his services to the British in carrying out their  colonial rule, the Asantehene had been knighted. His position as  the spiritual and temporal head of Ashanti gave him the in\u00ad fluence of a feudal lord over all the chiefs of the Region and over  the local people, and made him extremely powerful. By seeking  to safeguard his continued authority in the new Ghana through  specific clauses in the constitution, the British were not only  repaying him for services rendered and making good in part the  promise of the N.L.Mthe adoption of socialist policies, since in the African situation  genuine independence is incompatible with capitalism; while  the latter involved us in actively suppor ting the liberation and  unity movements in Africa. In both these tasks, my govern\u00ad ment immediately came up against opposition from the same  quarters as before, that is, from reactionary bour geois ele \u00ad ments inside Ghana, and from imperialist and neo-colonialist  interests outside. As before, these forces had a common inter\u00ad est; both wished to delay economic independence and to  impede the progress of the African revolution. The tactics they  employed were sui tably adju sted to the new situation.  After 19 57, having been repeatedly rejected by the elector\u00ad ate, the opposition lost hope of gaining office by constitutional  means, and embarked on a campaign of obstructing the work  of government without making any attempt to devise an al ter\u00ad native programme. They asserted themselves outside the  democratic framework. Their policies, always regional in con\u00ad cept, became purely destruc tive, subversive and violent. Before  independence they had been prepared to sacrifice our national  liberation in order to keep me and my colleagues out of  government; now they were ready to sabotage our newly-born  freedom and to hold up the African revolution by al lying  themselves even more closely with imperialists and the insidi\u00ad ous forces of neo-colonialism in causing a breakdown in  administration so that they might get a chance to grasp the  reins of office.  They employed every stratagem, from demanding the virtual  secession of Ashanti, the Northern Region and Togoland  from the sphere of Central Ghanaian authority, to a press cam\u00ad paign of abuse and lies to dis credit me and the government.  When this failed, they resorted to violence, assassination plots,  and eventually to the subversion of army and police officers.  For a time after 19 57 we tole rated the excesses of the  opposition, but when their actions began to undermine the  state and to jeopardise its independence we took measures,  like all governments do in times of national emergency, to  ensure the security of the nation. For example, we brought in  the Avoidance of Discrimination Bill to deal with the control  of political parties based on tribal and religious affiliations",
        "response": "Nkrumah's fall in 1966 had a profound and largely negative impact on Ghana's development. The context provides several key points:\n\n1. Nkrumah had implemented ambitious development plans, including the First and Second Five Year Development Plans and the Consolidation Plan. These aimed to modernize and industrialize Ghana, train a skilled workforce, and build essential public services.\n\n2. Under Nkrumah, Ghana had made significant progress, with 63 state enterprises and a budget of \u00a3200 million for a population of nearly 8 million, compared to Nigeria's budget of \u00a378 million for 55 million people.\n\n3. Nkrumah's government had borrowed to fund development, but this was based on creating lasting assets like the Volta dam and industries. The debt was seen as an index of investor confidence.\n\n4. Ghana had become a symbol of hope and inspiration for African liberation movements, hosting freedom fighters and political refugees from various countries.\n\n5. Nkrumah's fall led to a shift in Ghana's development trajectory. The new government, as Nkrumah himself notes, was \"made even more shaky by the attitude of the progressive independent states of Africa.\"\n\n6. The coup was seen as a blow against socialism and the African Revolution, with repercussions both domestically and internationally.\n\n7. Ghana's status as a haven for liberation movements ended, and its role as a vanguard of African liberation and unity was severely diminished.\n\n8. The new government's policies likely shifted away from Nkrumah's socialist direction, potentially impacting the pace and nature of Ghana's development.\n\n9. The political instability following the coup may have deterred foreign investment and economic growth.\n\n10. Ghana's international standing, which had been elevated under Nkrumah, likely decreased, potentially affecting its ability to secure favorable terms in international relations and trade.",
