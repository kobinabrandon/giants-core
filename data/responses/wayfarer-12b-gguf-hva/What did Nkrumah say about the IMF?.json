        "question": "What did Nkrumah say about the IMF?",
        "context": "these difficulties were not determinant. It was no mean achieve\u00ad ment that in January 19 65, after five years as a Republic,  Ghana had 63 state enterprises and a budget of \u00a3200 million,  including a supplementary budget, for its population of nearly  eight million; while Nigeria, richer in national resources and  with a popu lation of 55 million, had a budget of \u00a378 million.  Imperialist circles have talked much about Ghana's external  debt, given as \u00a3250 million. Apart from the dubious account\u00ad ing which arrived at this conveniently round sum, a figure such  as this means nothing unless it is set in the context of the over\u00ad all Ghanaian economic situation. To implement our various  Development Plans it was necessary to borrow considerable  sums of money, but it was borrowed on the basis of building  capital assets such as the Volta dam, and over 10 0 industries  established in Ghana since independence. The government  made sure that the international agreements signed were based  on economic feasibility, and that the money borrowed could  create something lasting and beneficial not only for us in our  lifetime but for the generations to follow. Seen in the light of  Ghana's growing industries and increasing exports, her \"in\u00ad debtedness\" is put in proper perspective-as an index of the  investors' confidence in the enterprise and the management  they helped to finance. In addition, it should be noted that only  some \u00a320 million was due to be paid in 19 67, and this did not  prevent the government from refusing the political conditions  attached to a loan from the International Monetary Fund  (I.M.F.).  Long faces are pulled at the drop in our foreign reserves  since independence. In 19 57, Ghana had a sterling balance of  \u00a3200 million. This has not been \"squandered\" as the imperial\u00ad ist press would have its readers believe. It has been used to  pay off succcessive balance of payments deficits due to the  rise in prices of imported consumer goods, and the drastic  fall in the price of our main export crop-cocoa. It should be  remembered that the sterling balance was in fact a forced loan  at negligible interest which Britain acquired from Ghana  during and after the Second World Wardetailed proposals for the economic emancipation of Ghana.  However, it brought results in the shape of the usual hand\u00ad outs granted by imperialists and neo-colonialists to well\u00ad behaved puppets. Within two weeks of the ending of legal  government in Ghana, the army and police traitors received  an invitation to send a mission to Washington for talks with  the International Monetary Fund and World Bank officials.  The upshot was a \u00a313 million stand-by credit received from  the l.M.F. and eventually new loans from the U.S.A., Canada  and West Germany. In addition, supplies of various foodstuffs  and other consumer goods were promised to provide the  necessary window dressing for the new regime.  In the recent wave of coups which have taken place in Asia,  Latin America and Africa, all this has come to be standard  practice. Wherever progressive governments have been re\u00ad placed by counter-revolutionary forces, imperialist financial  organisations have rushed to bolster them up with loans and  various forms of so-called \"aid\". It is a necessary corollary to  the \"big lie\" usually employed to justify the overthrow of  \"undesirable governments\"-the lie of \"economic chaos\" and  a \"starving\" population. But more important, it serves to  tighten the stranglehold of foreign economic control over the  captive people by creating more indebtedness and a deeper  penetration by foreign business interests.  The Economic Committee set up by the \"N.L.C.\" admitted  in a statement on 3rd March 19 66 that Ghana's economy was  \"basically strong\", and that a mere \u00a315 million was all that was  needed to overcome immediate difficulties. Yet members of  the Economic Committee went like beggars, cap in hand, for  talks in Washington, London, Bonn and other capitals greedily  snatching any niggardly hand-outs offered, and cravenly agree\u00ad ing to all kinds of conditions attached to themgives her one of the highest densities in the world. These are  factors which bear directly upon the planning for industrial  development and economic independence. They provide both  causes and solutions in the drawing up of programmes, and the  degree of adjustment that is made to the problems which they  also raise will depend upon the economic course that is taken. In Ghana, we have embarked on the socialist path to progress.  We want to see full employment, good housing and equal  opportunity for education and cultural advancement for all the  people up to the highest level possible. This means that: - prices of goods must not exceed wages; - house rentals must be within the means of all groups; - social welfare services must be open to all; - educational and cultural amenities must be available to  everyone. It means, in short, that the real income and standard of life of all  farmers and workers must rise appreciably. I have already made it clear that colonial rule precluded that  accumulation of capital among our citizens which would have  assisted thorough-going private investment in industrial con\u00ad struction. It has, therefore, been left to government, as the holder  of the means, to play the role of main entrepreneur in laying the  basis of the national economic and social advancement. If we  turned over to private interests the going concerns capitalized  out of national funds and national effort, as some of our critics  would like to see us do, we should be betraying the trust of the  great masses of our people for the greedy interests of a small  coterie of individuals, probably in alliance with foreign  capitalists. Production for private profit deprives a large section  of the people of the goods and services produced. If, therefore, we  are to fulfil our pledge to the people and achieve the programme  set out above, socialism is our only alternative. For socialism  assumes the public ownership of the means of production, the  land and its resources, and the use of those means in fulfilment  of the people\u2019s needs. Socialism, above all, is predicated upon the ability to satisfy  those needs. It is obvious, therefore, that Ghana at this time is  not possessed of the socialist means.  In keeping with my government's policy of linking Ghana's  progress with Africa's total development, provision was made  in the Plan for economic co-operation with other African  states. As I said in my address to the National Assembly on  11 th l\\1arch 19 64 :  82  \"While we wait for the setting up of a Union Govern\u00ad ment for Africa, we must begin immediately to har\u00ad monise our plans for Africa's total development. For  example, I see no reason why the independent African  states should not, with advantage to each other, join  together in an economic union and draw up together aIt withheld investment and credit guarantees from potential  investors, put pressure on existing providers of credit to the  Ghanaian economy, and negated applications for loans made  by Ghana to American-do minated financial institutions such  as the l.M.F.  This pressure ended smartly after 24th February 19 66 when  the U.S. State Department's political objective had been  achieved. The price of cocoa suddenly rose on the world  market, and the I.M.F. rushed to the aid of the \"N.L.C.\"  If further proof were needed of America's political motives  it may be seen in the U.S. government's hysterical reaction to  the publication of my book, Neo-Colonialism - The  Last Stage of Imperialism in October 19 65. In this book I  exposed the economic stranglehold exercised by foreign  monopo listic complexes such as the Anglo-American Corpora\u00ad tion, and illustrated the ways in which this financial grip per\u00ad petuated the paradox of Africa : poverty in the midst of  plenty. The American Government sent me a note of protest,  and promptly refused Ghana $35 million of \"aid\".  The fact that our enemies decided finally on subversion and  violence as the only effective way in which to achieve their  objective of halting the Ghanaian revolution and bringing  Ghana into the neo-colon ialist fold, is a measure of the success  of our economic policies. We had proved that we were strong  enough to develop independently, not only without foreign  tutelage, but also in the context of active imperialist and neo\u00ad colo nialist resistance.  96",
        "response": "Nkrumah was highly critical of the IMF. He wrote that the IMF rushed to aid the \"NLC\" regime after the 1966 coup, providing a \u00a313 million stand-by credit. Nkrumah viewed this as a standard practice by imperialist financial organizations to bolster counter-revolutionary forces that overthrow progressive governments. He also noted that the U. S. government refused Ghana $35 million of \"aid\" after Nkrumah published his book Neo-Colonialism, which exposed the economic stranglehold of foreign monopolistic complexes.",
