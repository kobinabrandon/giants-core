        "question": "What policies did the coup plotters implement once they overthrew Nkrumah?",
        "context": "of our development plans and of their implementation reveals  the truth-that it was their success and not their failure which  spurred our enemies into action. Ghana, on the threshold of  economic independence, and in the vanguard of the African  revolutionary struggle to achieve continental liberation and  unity, was too dangerous an example to the rest of Africa to  be allowed to continue under a socialist-directed government.  In the first ten years of its administration, the Ghana gov\u00ad ernment drew up the First and Second Five Year Development  Plans (19 51-19 56 and 19 59-1 964), and the Consolidation Plan,  which covered the two-year gap between these Plans (1 957- 19 59). Under these Plans the foundations were to be laid for  the modernisation and industrialisation of Ghana. A skilled  labour force was to be trained and an adequate complement  of public services built up such as transport, electricity, water  and telecommunications.  We had to work fast. Under colonial rule, foreign monopoly  interests had tied up our whole economy to suit themselves.  We had not a single industry. Our economy was dependent on  one cash crop--cocoa. Although our output of cocoa is the  largest in the world, there was not a single cocoa processing  factory.  Before we took office in 1951 there was no direct railway  between Accra and Takoradi, in those days our main port.  Passengers and freight had to travel by way of Kumasi. This  was because Kumasi was the centre of the timber and mining  ind ustries, both of which served foreign interests and were  therefore well supplied with the necessary communications.  There were few roads, and only a very rudimentary public  transport system. For the most part, people walked from place  to place. There were very few hospitals, schools or clinics.  Most of our villages lacked a piped water supply. In fact, the  nakedness of the land when my government began in 1951 has  to have been experienced to be believed.  Failure to promote the interests of our people was due to the  insatiable demands of colonial exploitationthe adoption of socialist policies, since in the African situation  genuine independence is incompatible with capitalism; while  the latter involved us in actively suppor ting the liberation and  unity movements in Africa. In both these tasks, my govern\u00ad ment immediately came up against opposition from the same  quarters as before, that is, from reactionary bour geois ele \u00ad ments inside Ghana, and from imperialist and neo-colonialist  interests outside. As before, these forces had a common inter\u00ad est; both wished to delay economic independence and to  impede the progress of the African revolution. The tactics they  employed were sui tably adju sted to the new situation.  After 19 57, having been repeatedly rejected by the elector\u00ad ate, the opposition lost hope of gaining office by constitutional  means, and embarked on a campaign of obstructing the work  of government without making any attempt to devise an al ter\u00ad native programme. They asserted themselves outside the  democratic framework. Their policies, always regional in con\u00ad cept, became purely destruc tive, subversive and violent. Before  independence they had been prepared to sacrifice our national  liberation in order to keep me and my colleagues out of  government; now they were ready to sabotage our newly-born  freedom and to hold up the African revolution by al lying  themselves even more closely with imperialists and the insidi\u00ad ous forces of neo-colonialism in causing a breakdown in  administration so that they might get a chance to grasp the  reins of office.  They employed every stratagem, from demanding the virtual  secession of Ashanti, the Northern Region and Togoland  from the sphere of Central Ghanaian authority, to a press cam\u00ad paign of abuse and lies to dis credit me and the government.  When this failed, they resorted to violence, assassination plots,  and eventually to the subversion of army and police officers.  For a time after 19 57 we tole rated the excesses of the  opposition, but when their actions began to undermine the  state and to jeopardise its independence we took measures,  like all governments do in times of national emergency, to  ensure the security of the nation. For example, we brought in  the Avoidance of Discrimination Bill to deal with the control  of political parties based on tribal and religious affiliationsno longer trust in a broad coalition of interests. The old  civil service and the Judiciary went over almost to a man to  the usurping regime. By so doing they were of course serving  personal interests and to this extent what they did was under\u00ad standable if not excusable. The lesson, however, which their  conduct provides, is that they had no loyalty to the state or  understanding of the social purposes which we were attempt\u00ad ing to achieve. It might be possible to work in the future  with people who were merely dishonest through self-interest  but it is absolutely impossible to utilize a machine which  has shown itself so defective of understanding.  For these reasons, the \"coup\" has achieved something  which it would have been impossible to achieve without  it, namely, a complete and public exposure of the impossibility  of continuing along old lines.  The slate has been wiped clean and now at least we  can begin to build again upon new foundations. For the  people of Ghana life under the \"N.L.C.\" is a form of political  education which they could never otherwise have had. For  the C.P.P. it is an even more important lesson in that it shows  that the old organisation was defective and that the old  leadership in many cases which was inherited from the  struggle against British imperialism was inadequate for its  task and when put to the test of crisis failed.  In the old days popular opinion forced me to maintain  in positions of authority individuals who were well-known  in their localities through their local families and tribal  infl uences. In the past many such people rendered impor\u00ad tant services to the Party. Now, however, a new testing time  has arisen and these people, when weighed against events,  have had all the defects of their characters exposed for the  whole world to see.  In a larger sense the \"coup d'etat\" has made it plain that the  C.P.P. can no longer follow the path of the old line. It must  develop a new and reformed revolutionary leadership which  must come from the broad mass of the Partythe \"heroes of the counter-revolution\", the criminal detainees.  These people assaulted women, thieved, and looted. It will  be only after the return to legal government in Ghana that  it will be possible to assess exactly the number of those who  died in fighting against the rebel soldiers or were subsequently  killed in the looting and robbery which followed. The casual\u00ad ties in the fighting were certainly heavy. The number of  civilians killed, it is more difficult to estimate. Two members  of Parliament certainly lost their lives and a number of people  in no way connected with politics died. Among those shot  dead near Flagstaff House was an air hostess on her way to  the airport. In all, the total was probably around 1, 600 dead  and many more injured . So much for the \"bloodless coup\"!  One thing is clear. Never before in the cherished history  of our new Ghana had citizens, defenceless men and women,  been assassinated in cold blood by their own soldiers. Not a  single Ghanaian life was taken during the whole fifteen years  of my administration. There are few, if any, governments  in the world which can say as much. Yet here was this  handful of traitors at one blow spoiling our proud record, and  dragging Ghana's name through the mud.  In the days which followed the insurrection, hundreds of  patriotic Ghanaians were thrown into prison. All ministers.  M.P.s , officials of the Party and of all its subsidiary and  associate organisations including the trade unions were  arrested and detained. The same applied to branch officers  throughout the country. In fact, the entire leadership, except  for the few who managed to escape or go into hiding, was  at one swoop rounded up and thrown into prison.  The prison authorities, with some exceptions, continued  to act in the humane and considerate way which we had  insisted upon in the prison service, since the establishment  of independence. The Director of Prisons, in particular, saw  to it that no one, insofar as he could prevent it, once inside  the prison, was ill-treatedexposed themselves in their true colours for all to see. By their  very actions, on 24th February and in the months of \"N.L.C.\"  rule, they have clearly shown themselves to be traitors to their  country and the stooges of neo-colonialism. They have dis\u00ad played their reactionary nature, their complete disregard for  the common man and for the progress of the African Revolu\u00ad tion.  It is like when you boil a pot hard; all the bits and pieces of  useless stuff come to the top and you are able to skim them off  easily. It is necessary to realise, that, in many ways, the  so-called \"coup d'etat\" has not been a set-back but has been  merely a symptom of how neo-colo nialism is breaking down.  Almost all African countries came to independence without  armed struggle. This meant that it was impossible, in practice,  to reconstruct these new states upon a socialist basis  immediately. I was well aware of the compromises which  it was necessary to make and the dangers which this entailed  but Ghana's independence on any condition was the first  essential in securing the freedom of Africa. Not to have  seized independence when we had a chance of obtaining  it, whatever the liability we inherited, would have been  criminal. The circumstances under which the C.P.P. was  formed resulted in it being a compromise organisation com\u00ad posed of some genuine revolutionaries but containing many  of those who are interested in independence only so as to  better themselves and to take the place of the previous  colonial traders and businessmen. This meant that I had to  include in any government which I formed representatives  of all tendencies in the Party including businessmen on the  make such as Emmanuel Ayeh-Kumi and William Halm.  In the circumstances of the day there was at least a reason\u00b7  able chance that such people would act honestly and would  assist to build the state on a new basis.  The experiment which we tried in Ghana was essentially  one of developing the country in co-op eration with the world  as a whole. Non-alignment meant exactly what it said",
        "response": " The coup plotters, led by the National Liberation Council (NLC), implemented several policies after overthrowing Nkrumah in 1966. These included:\n\n1. Arresting and detaining Nkrumah's supporters, including government officials, MPs, and party leaders.\n\n2. Banning the Convention People's Party (CPP) and other pro-Nkrumah organizations.\n\n3.

Promoting a more pro-Western foreign policy, including closer ties with the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\n8. Implementing austerity measures to address the economic crisis left by Nkrumah's rule.\n\n9. Revising the educational system, which had been heavily influenced by Nkrumah's ideologies.\n\n10.

        "context": "of our development plans and of their implementation reveals  the truth-that it was their success and not their failure which  spurred our enemies into action.

Failure to promote the interests of our people was due to the  insatiable demands of colonial exploitationdetailed proposals for the economic emancipation of Ghana.  However, it brought results in the shape of the usual hand\u00ad outs granted by imperialists and neo-colonialists to well\u00ad behaved puppets. Within two weeks of the ending of legal  government in Ghana, the army and police traitors received  an invitation to send a mission to Washington for talks with  the International Monetary Fund and World Bank officials.  The upshot was a \u00a313 million stand-by credit received from  the l.M.F. and eventually new loans from the U.S.A., Canada  and West Germany. In addition, supplies of various foodstuffs  and other consumer goods were promised to provide the  necessary window dressing for the new regime.  In the recent wave of coups which have taken place in Asia,  Latin America and Africa, all this has come to be standard  practice. Wherever progressive governments have been re\u00ad placed by counter-revolutionary forces, imperialist financial  organisations have rushed to bolster them up with loans and  various forms of so-called \"aid\". It is a necessary corollary to  the \"big lie\" usually employed to justify the overthrow of  \"undesirable governments\"-the lie of \"economic chaos\" and  a \"starving\" population. But more important, it serves to  tighten the stranglehold of foreign economic control over the  captive people by creating more indebtedness and a deeper  penetration by foreign business interests.  The Economic Committee set up by the \"N.L.C.\" admitted  in a statement on 3rd March 19 66 that Ghana's economy was  \"basically strong\", and that a mere \u00a315 million was all that was  needed to overcome immediate difficulties. Yet members of  the Economic Committee went like beggars, cap in hand, for  talks in Washington, London, Bonn and other capitals greedily  snatching any niggardly hand-outs offered, and cravenly agree\u00ad ing to all kinds of conditions attached to themthe adoption of socialist policies, since in the African situation  genuine independence is incompatible with capitalism; while  the latter involved us in actively suppor ting the liberation and  unity movements in Africa. In both these tasks, my govern\u00ad ment immediately came up against opposition from the same  quarters as before, that is, from reactionary bour geois ele \u00ad ments inside Ghana, and from imperialist and neo-colonialist  interests outside.

For example, we brought in  the Avoidance of Discrimination Bill to deal with the control  of political parties based on tribal and religious affiliationspossible to extend, its grip on the economic life of our con\u00ad tinent.  An all-out offensive is being waged against the progressive,  independent states. Where the more subtle methods of econ\u00ad omic pressure and political subversion have failed to achieve  the desired result, there has been resort to violence in order  to promote a change of regime and prepare the way for the  establishment of a puppet government.  Fragmented into so many separate states, many of them  weak and economically non-viable, coup d'etats have been  relatively easy to arrange in Africa. All that has been needed  was a small force of disciplined men to seize the key points of  the capital city and to arrest the existing political leadership.  In the planning and carrying out of these coups there have  always been just sufficient numbers of dissatisfied and ambiti\u00ad ous army officers and politicians willing to co-operate to make  the whole operation possible.  It has been one of the tasks of the Cl.A and other similar  organisations to discover these potential quislings and traitors  in our midst, and to encourage them, t; bribery and the pro\u00ad mise of political power, to destroy the constitutional govern\u00ad ment of their countries. In Ghana the embassies of the United  States, Britain, and West Germany were all implicated in the  plot to overthrow my government. It is alleged that the U.S.  Ambassador, Franklin Williams, offered the traitors 13 million  dollars to carry out a coup d'etat. Afrifa, Hadley and Kotoka  were to get a large share of this if they would assassinate me at  Accra airport as I prepared to leave for Hanoi. I understand  Afrifa said: \"I think I will fail'', and declined the offer.  So apparently did the others.  It is particularly disgraceful that it should have been an  Afro-American ambassador who sold himself out to the  imperialists and allowed himself to be used in this way. It was  this same man who deliberately lied when he publicly des\u00ad cribed the coup as \"bloodless.\" However, his treachery pro\u00ad vides a sharp reminder of the insidious ways in which the  enemies of Africa can operatesame period, to grant revolving loans of \u00a32 million to Ghana\u00ad ian producers organised into co-o peratives.  When the Party came to power in 19 51, all impo rted goods  were in the hands of a few big foreign firms, especially the  monopolist United Africa Company, part of the Unilever  complex. Foreign firms dominated Ghana's trade and virtually  controlled the economy. By 19 65, however, the grip was being  broken. The nationalised Ghana National Trading Corpora\u00ad tion was distributing 32 per cent of all imports.  My government was also breaking through the  stranglehold of the big international banking houses. In 19 58,  foreign banks held one-third of Ghana's foreign currency  reserves; in 19 65 they held none.  Our success in breaking the web of economic control which  Western capitalism has imposed across the whole of the Afri\u00b7  can continent, and our clear socialist policies, provoked the  hostility of the imperialist powers. They knew that as long  as I was alive and at the head of the Party in Ghana the  process could not be halted and neo-colonialist exploitation  could not be re-impo sed. Ours was a system they could neither  penetrate nor manipulate.  Significantly, one of the first acts of the \"N.L.C.\" was to  announce the abandonment of the Seven Year Development  Plan, which would have given the Ghanaian people the only  worthwhile independence -real economic independence. The  \"N.L .C.\" replaced it with a two-year \"review period\" dur ing  which the socialis ed industries would be dismantled and the  door opened once more to unrestricted \"p rivate enterprise\"\u00ad in fact, they were establishi ng a neo-colonialist economic sub\u00ad jugation of Ghana.  The only Ghanaians to benefit from such a sell-out were the  African middle-class hangers-on to neo-colonialist privilege  and the neo-colonialist trading firms",
        "response": " The coup plotters, led by the National Liberation Council (NLC), implemented several policies after overthrowing Nkrumah in 1966. Their primary focus was on reversing Nkrumah's socialist policies and reorienting Ghana's economy towards a more capitalist model. Key economic policies included:\n\n1. Abandonment of the Seven Year Development Plan: The NLC replaced Nkrumah's ambitious development plan with a two-year \"review period,\" effectively halting major infrastructure projects and industrialization efforts.\n\n2. Privatization of state-owned enterprises: Many of the industries nationalized under Nkrumah were privatized, including the Ghana National Trading Corporation.\n\n3. Deregulation of the economy: The NLC introduced policies to open up Ghana's economy to foreign investment and private enterprise, reversing Nkrumah's protectionist measures.\n\n4. Foreign debt restructuring: The NLC sought and received substantial foreign aid and loans from organizations like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, as well as individual countries like the United States, United Kingdom, and West Germany.\n\n5. Currency devaluation: The cedi was devalued to address balance of payments issues, making Ghanaian goods more competitive in international markets.\n\n6. Agricultural liberalization: The NLC encouraged private investment in agriculture and reduced government control over the sector.\n\n7. Reduction of government spending: The new regime cut back on many of Nkrumah's social programs and reduced government expenditure.\n\n8. Reversal of labor policies: The NLC repealed some of Nkrumah's labor laws, making it easier for businesses to hire and fire workers.\n\n9. Foreign investment promotion: The NLC actively courted foreign investors, particularly in the mining and oil sectors.\n\n10. Financial sector reforms: The NLC introduced measures to stabilize the banking sector and reduce inflation.\n\nThese policies were aimed at stabilizing the economy and reorienting Ghana towards a more capitalist model, but they also deepened Ghana's economic dependence on foreign powers and multinational corporations.",
