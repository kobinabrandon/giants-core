        "context": "76 AFRICA MUST UNITE minority needed armed protection against the indigenous  majority. In fledgeling states, imperialist interests flourish where there is  an atmosphere of dissension. They are endangered in an atmosphere of   national unity and stability. For two and a half years of difficult state-building my govern\u00ad ment took no action to limit the freedom of the press. The  opposition was quick to exploit this freedom and soon debased  it into licence. Each day, its newspapers came out with screaming  headlines about the perfidy of the government. They heaped  abuse and libel upon my colleagues and me. They wrote and  preached, they called press conferences with local and foreign  correspondents, they addressed public meetings all over the  country, stigmatizing the government and singling out me and  my immediate associates for special attack, abuse and ridicule. During the struggle for independence we had emphasized the  need for national unity for the attainment of freedom, and for  the enormous responsibilities of statehood that wrould follow.  These call for a supreme effort on the part of every citizen. How  could our people pull their weight with zeal and dedication when  it was ceaselessly being drummed into them that their govern\u00ad ment was unscrupulous, inept and corrupt; that their leaders  were venal and power-thirsty, and that the national effort was  invoked, not for the greater glory of Ghana but for the personal  glory of Kwame Nkrumah? This was not freedom of expression.  This was irresponsible licence, and if allowed to continue un\u00ad bridled, it could have undermined our state, our independence  and the people\u2019s faith in themselves and their capacities. This was the internal picture. The impact on the movements  for liberation in the rest of Africa could be just as unfortunate.  It was likely to cause despondency in their ranks and friction  between us and their leaders, who might have no means of  recognizing the falsity of opposition attacks upon us. The colonial  powers would also not be unmindful of these happenings and  possibly use them as a pretext for delaying their departure from  trust and colonial territories by citing the magnified political  \u2018battle\u2019 in Ghana as a frightening example of premature  independenceAFRICA MUST UNITE The Inga project could go a long way towards electrifying the  whole of the African continent. If the independent states had a united, integrated economic  policy, the building of the Inga dam could be carefully planned  to support an extended industrial growth, catering for a far  larger population. Its cost would, therefore, be economically  spread. This is only a single illustration of what African inte\u00ad grated economic planning might do. Extend it to all sectors of  our economies, and its possibilities are infinite. I have often been accused of pursuing \u2018a policy of the im\u00ad possible\u2019. But I cannot believe in the impossibility of achieving  African union any more than I could ever have thought of the  impossibility of attaining African freedom. When I came back  to Ghana in 1947 to take a leading part in the anti-colonial  struggle, I was dubbed an \u2018irresponsible agitator\u2019. Independence  at that time looked a long way off. None of us really imagined  that by 1962 most of the African countries would have thrown  off political domination and embarked upon their own national  existence as sovereign states. But that did not stop us from going  forward with our efforts, buoyed by the certainty of ultimate  victory. And it has come, as I said, much sooner than anticipated. That is how I feel about African union. Just as I was con\u00ad vinced that political freedom was the essential forerunner of our  economic growth and that it must come, so I am equally con\u00ad vinced that African union will come and provide that united,  integrated base upon which our fullest development can be  secured. There is no doubt that the task before us is a challenging  one. No easy road to the achievement of modem industrializa\u00ad tion has so far been discovered. The most we can hope is to learn  from the more glaring mistakes of those who have preceded us  on the road what we should obviously avoid, and what will most  assist us in pushing forward to the goal as speedily as possible  without sustaining too many bitter shocks to the body politic184 AFRICA MUST UNITE There is no need to underscore the intention it so blatantly  exposes in \u2018playing the game5  of\u2018buying time5. It should be an  object lesson for all those African statesmen who think that  associations with non-African powers will foster their true  interests and give them the opportunity to prosper their nations  within continuing independence of action. This objective can  only be achieved by close economic association between the  African states themselves, which in turn presupposes close  political co-operation between them. It is on account of its  retrograde consequences for the cause of African unity and  economic independence that the government of Ghana is so  completely opposed to the European Community in its present  form. That many of the leaders of the new African states find them\u00ad selves in a perplexing position, there is no doubt. They are  strongly dependent on foreign contributions simply to maintain  the machinery of their governments. Many of them have  deliberately been made so weak economically, by being carved  up into many separate countries, that they are not able to sustain  out of their own resources the machinery of independent govern\u00ad ment, the cost of which cannot be reduced beyond a certain  minimum. I recognize the impossible position in which they  were placed when the transfer of power took place. Their  frontiers were not of their own choosing, and they were left  with an economic, administrative and educational system which,  each in its own way, was designed to perpetuate the colonial  relationship. Ghana\u2019s case was no different, but we are making decisive  efforts to change the pattern and are determined to retain our  independence of policy and action. I regard as culpable the  insidious reluctance of these states to formulate an independent  policy even though it may involve the loss of the contributions  which were offered in exchange for continued conformity to the  policies of the colonial powers. Equally reprehensible is the  refusal to give recognition to the nature of the new imperialism  that is using them as pawns in keeping Africa divided, as a means  of aborting total independence and maintaining neo-colonial  hegemony. Worse still are the deceits in the pretended willing\u00ad ness of some leaders to co-operate on certain levels of African62 AFRICA MUST UNITE The unrest which prevailed in certain parts of the country at  the launching of our independence was not made any less by the  provisions relating to the setting up of Regional Assemblies and  the powers to be invested in them. The British negotiators of our  constitution were more amenable to the federal aspirations of the  Opposition than to the C.P.P. which represented the wishes of  the majority of the people. The Opposition view was prompted  by motives of political separatism, and these were reflected in the  constitutional clauses relating to the establishment of Regional  Assemblies. In the same way, every opportunity was provided by the con\u00ad stitution for cramping our development endeavours. In com\u00ad munications, for instance, the Government might decide on a  trunk road that would pass through several Regions. Opposition  by the Regional Assembly of one affected Region could hold up  the project indefinitely. As part of its national health scheme, the  Government might determine the sites on which hospitals and  clinics should be built. The Regional Assemblies could object to  and obstruct these plans, in keeping with their constitutional  authority over the regional health and medical services. It was laid down that \u2018in each Region there shall be a Head of  the Region, who, except in the case of the Ashanti Region, shall  be chosen by the House of Chiefs in the Region\u2019. No democratic  principle was to be employed but use made instead of the out\u00ad moded procedure current under the colonial system of Indirect  Rule which gave authority to compliant chiefs. If the chiefs of a  certain Region happened to be opposed to modern health  methods and medical practices, they could effectively block any  Government programmes involving up-to-date treatment of  disease in their area, for the restrictions of the constitution would  safeguard them. Extend this to education, public works, housing,  agricultural and industrial development, and it can be accepted  that the central Government would have been in the position of  possessing merely token sovereignty. Our hands and feet would  be virtually bound the moment we attempted to govern. The ground, it can be seen, was well laid for the promotion of  disunity and fragmentation136 AFRICA MUST UNITE ficant later, though the conference in Lagos never, in fact, took  place. When I returned to West Africa in 1947, it was with the  intention of using the Gold Coast as a starting-off point for  African independence and unity. With the mass movement I  was able to build up in the Convention People\u2019s Party, the Gold  Coast secured its freedom and emerged as the sovereign state of  Ghana in 1957. I at once made it clear that there would be no  meaning to the national independence of Ghana unless it was  linked with the total liberation of the African continent. While  our independence celebrations were actually taking place, I  called for a conference of all the sovereign states of Africa, to  discuss plans for the future of our continent. The first Conference of Independent African States met in  Accra in April 1958. There wrere then only eight, namely, Egypt,  Ghana, Sudan, Libya, Tunisia, Liberia, Morocco and Ethiopia.  Our purpose was to exchange views on matters of common  interest; to explore ways and means of consolidating and safe\u00ad guarding our independence; to strengthen the economic and  cultural ties between our countries; to decide on workable  arrangements for helping fellow Africans still subject to colonial  rule; and to examine the central world problem of how to secure  peace. When, on 15 April 1958 ,1 welcomed the representatives to the  conference, I felt that at last Pan-Africanism had moved to the  African continent where it really belonged. It was an historic  occasion. Free Africans were actually meeting together, in  Africa, to examine and consider African affairs. Here was a signal  departure from established custom, a jar to the arrogant  assumption of non-African nations that African affairs were  solely the concern of states outside our continent. The African  personality was making itself known. Because many of the speeches made at the conference were  similar in content, it was alleged in some quarters that there had  been previous collaboration. I am able to state categorically that  all of us who spoke had prepared our speeches independently.  If they showed identity of thought and belief, it was because our  attitudes in Africa were assuming an identity of vision and  purpose.",
        "response": "Nkrumah was insistent that Africa must unite for several key reasons:\n\n1. Colonial legacy: Africa was artificially divided by European powers, creating numerous small states with weak economies. Unity would allow for more efficient resource allocation and economic growth.\n\n2. Security concerns: A united Africa would be better equipped to defend against external threats and internal strife, as seen in the need for armed protection against the indigenous majority.\n\n3. Imperialist interests: Nkrumah believed that imperialist powers would exploit African disunity to maintain influence and control over the continent's resources.\n\n4. National unity: Nkrumah emphasized the importance of national unity for state-building and progress, viewing disunity as a threat to stability and progress.\n\n5. Pan-Africanism: Nkrumah's personal history and philosophy were deeply rooted in Pan-Africanism, which viewed Africa as a single entity with shared interests.\n\n6. Economic integration: The Inga project and other initiatives could benefit the entire continent if planned and executed through a unified African economic policy.\n\n7. Political independence: Nkrumah saw African unity as essential for maintaining true political independence, as opposed to the \"neo-colonialism\" he feared would result from continued foreign influence.\n\n8. Historical precedent: Nkrumah drew parallels between the struggle for independence and the struggle for unity, believing that just as independence came sooner than expected, so too would unity.\n\n9. Development potential: A united Africa could more effectively pursue modern industrialization and development, learning from the mistakes of others and avoiding unnecessary setbacks.\n\n10. Cultural identity: Nkrumah viewed African unity as a means of asserting and celebrating the African personality and identity on the world stage.",

Where there is no settler  problem, as in West Africa, the struggle has been hard, though  on the whole peaceful and constitutional. I have already told  how independence was achieved in Ghana.1 Looking back, and trying to determine the reasons for the  successful outcome of our struggle for freedom, one factor stands  out above all others, namely, the strength of a well-organized  political party, representative of the broad mass of the people.  The Convention People\u2019s Party represented the ordinary,  common folk who wanted social justice and a higher standard of  living. It kept in daily, living touch with the ordinary mass of  people it represented, unlike the opposition, which was supported  by a galaxy of lawyers and members of other conservative pro\u00ad fessions, the self-styled \u2018aristocracy5  of the Gold Coast. They did  not understand the new mood of the people, the growing  nationalism and the revolt against economic hardship. Thinking  that their lofty assertions were enough to win adherents to their  ranks, they made little effort to come into close contact with the  masses in the way that I had done in my early days as secretary of  the U.G.C.C., and continued through my years of leadership of  the C.P.P. As a matter of fact, when the leaders of the U.G.C.C.  discovered that I had spearheaded a mass movement, they  recoiled in fright. That was something they had not bargained  for. They had wanted me to build up a movement whose ranks  would not question their self-assumed right to political leader\u00ad ship, but would nevertheless provide a solid enough base for them  to pose as the national champions in pressing for constitutional  change. It was when the leaders of the U.G.C.C62 AFRICA MUST UNITE The unrest which prevailed in certain parts of the country at  the launching of our independence was not made any less by the  provisions relating to the setting up of Regional Assemblies and  the powers to be invested in them.
