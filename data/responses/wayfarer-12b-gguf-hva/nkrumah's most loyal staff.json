        "context": "Assemblies, Ashanti was omitted and special regulations were  introduced giving it powers superior to those of the other Regions.  Everywhere else the head of the Region was to be chosen by the  House of Chiefs. In Ashanti, the constitution specifically stated  that \u2018the Asantehene shall be the Head of the Ashanti Region\u2019.  What kind of democracy were the British laying down on the eve  of their departure, in designating the person who was to be the  effective governor of a particular Region? Where was the  respect for our sovereignty ? Our independence was supposed to  give us sovereignty over our own affairs. But there we were, a  democratic Government, limited by constitutional provisions,  designed by the retiring power, to a designated individual to  conduct the highest executive post in the most delicate national  territory. It was so openly a device to concede to the opposition  party the opportunities they had been deprived of by their  defeat at the polls that it was difficult to believe the British  could have been so deceitful to their much-vaunted respect for  democracy. The choice of the Asantehene for this special elevation was  deliberate. He was known to share the views of the National  Liberation Movement, whose politics of violence had made our  final steps to independence so immensely difficult. Considerable  suspicion as to his original connections with the Movement had  been current since its inception, because his chief linguist, the  man closest to him in the affairs of the Ashanti state, was a  founder member and its Chairman. The Asantehene had  worked well with the British, even though his uncle Prempeh I  had fought them in the Ashanti wars earlier in the century and  had been exiled to the Seychelles islands for his African  patriotism. For his services to the British in carrying out their  colonial rule, the Asantehene had been knighted. His position as  the spiritual and temporal head of Ashanti gave him the in\u00ad fluence of a feudal lord over all the chiefs of the Region and over  the local people, and made him extremely powerful. By seeking  to safeguard his continued authority in the new Ghana through  specific clauses in the constitution, the British were not only  repaying him for services rendered and making good in part the  promise of the N.L.M. He must be grappling with his work all the time, thinking  twenty-four hours a day how best he can serve his country by his  performance for the ministry in which he works. The Ghanaian  civil servant must be utterly devoted and dedicated to the ideal  of reconstructing our country. He must show leadership, he  must, like his Minister, set an example to the people he serves.  He must be a pioneer. These are the demands which we make of our civil service.  They are high, for the task of the civil servant in the building upservice much more than I was with the army and the police  and I was able, in many cases, to reform the diplomatic and  the information services. Despite this, throughout the public  service as a whole, there was a tradition of serving whatever  government was in power. Many of the senior officials had  all originally served with the old colonial regime which had  opposed trade unionism and socialism in any form and was  against any real representation of the people in government.  After the C.C.P.'s victory in 19 51 they changed over to admin\u00ad ister the new ideas, becoming suppor ters of \"enlightened  colonialism\".  When colonialism gave way to independence, these same  men gave support to the new order of things. As gradually  we changed social and political conditions in Ghana they  accepted the changes without protest and though there may  have been a degree of sabotage behind the scenes, always  openly proffered their support for my policies and that of  my Party.  In such circumstances it is only natural that they should  have in the first place uncritically accepted the rebel govern\u00ad ment. Indeed behind the scenes the civil servants always  looked back to the colonial times when their senior members  were described as \"political officers\" and they in practice  ran the country. They welcomed the military revolt because  they believed that behind the facade of military power they  would be the real rulers. It is only now that they are becom\u00ad ing disillusioned and are discovering that however incom\u00ad petent in administration and politics senior military and police  officers are, those who have seized power are determined to  use their authority to maintain their own personal interests.  There is quite a record of police hostility towards me per\u00ad sonally and towards my government. It dates back to pre\u00ad independence days when I was campaigning for freedom from  colonial rule, and the British government founded the Special  Branch in Ghana to keep an eye on me. For years, members  of the Special Branch were trained to regard me as a dangerous  man whose political views and activities threatened all that  was stable and respectable in British eyes. Harlley, Deku and  Nunoo all served in the Special Branchpeople who wish Ghana and you all the best. The Ghanaians  are a vigorous and lively people and they deserve all the vision  and leadership which you strove to give them, to make Ghana  into a strong, modern part of an Africa whose unity you have  always espoused.  My colleague, Rajaratnam, and I remember your kindness  to us and your support for Singapore and would like to express  our sympathy for you in your moment of distress.  May what you stand for, a united Africa and a great Ghana,  triumph and flourish.  163trained civil servants. They had made their way up through  the colonial structure. They had been among my most trusted  officials but they chose to return to Ghana, presumably in  the hope that they would be accepted by the counter\u00ad revolutionaries.  Enoch Okoh, as head of the civil service and as the person  who knew therefore which promotions had been made and  why, was treated with leniency and wa:s appointed to be in  charge of the Housing Corporation. Since the new regime  did not intend to build any houses for the people this was  perhaps the appropriate punishment for his desertion.  Michael Dei-Ana ng was not so treated and, much to his  surprise, was thrown into prison.  Fred Arkhurst, after his treachery, returned to his former  position at the United Nations but was eventually removed  by the 'N.L.C.' who could not trust someone who had, at  least, ability.  Naturally, we were all of us anxious about the safety of our  families in Ghana, but I suppose the official members of the  party were also thinking about their bank accounts and their  property. It is said that a man's heart lies where his treasure  is. But even allowing for the fact that they had more to lose  than the other personnel, I still find it hard to understand how  they could have lost grip of themselves so easily. It was as  though they had put their hands up at the first whiff of danger.  However, they did manage to pull themselves together suffi\u00ad ciently for me to be able to discuss the next moves with them.  It was not until later, after they had left Peking, and were on  their own, that the full depth of their defeatism became appar\u00ad ent, and they deserted.  We agreed that for the next day or two, while arrangements  were being made. I should carry out official engagements as  planned .  This was also the wish of the Chinese government. The  Chinese made it clear that they regarded the military and  police action in Ghana as no more than a temporary obstacle  in the long struggle against imperialism",
        "response": " Based on the context provided, Nkrumah's most loyal staff appears to have been his trusted civil servants, particularly those who had risen through the colonial structure. The text mentions that \"they had been among my most trusted officials but they chose to return to Ghana, presumably in the hope that they would be accepted by the counter-revolutionaries.\" This suggests that despite their loyalty to Nkrumah, they prioritized their own interests and safety over his cause. The text also notes that some, like Enoch Okoh, were treated leniently, while others like Michael Dei-Anang were imprisoned. This indicates that loyalty was not universal, and that Nkrumah's staff's actions were largely motivated by self-preservation rather than unwavering dedication to his cause.",
