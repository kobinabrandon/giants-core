    This was Dr Kwame Nkrumah, a towering figure whose vision and determination ignited the flames of independence across Africa. 

    H.E. Dr Kwame Nkrumah 
    the first leader of an independent country in sub-Saharan Africa. His passionate insistence on
    "independence now", and his Pan-African vision made him a dominant force in post-colonial Africa, and a source of inspiration
    for anti-colonial movements around the world. 

    After serving as the country's first president for 9 years, his government was toppled during a trip to Vietnam.
